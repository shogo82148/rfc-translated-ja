PIM\r\nprovides an efficient solution that prevents sending multiple copies\r\nof the same packet over the same physical link; however, it may not\r\nalways be deployed in the NVO network core. Ingress replication\r\navoids the dependency on PIM in the NVO network core. While ingress\r\nreplication provides a simple multicast transport, some NVO networks\r\nwith demanding multicast applications require a more efficient\r\nsolution without PIM in the core. This document describes a solution\r\nto optimize the efficiency of ingress replication trees.","pub_date":"May 2024","keywords":["Assisted Replication","AR","AR-Replicator","RNVE","Pruned Flood List","PFL","Pruned Flooding List"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9574","errata_url":null}
