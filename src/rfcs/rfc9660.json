The SERIAL\r\nfield from the Start of Authority (SOA) resource record (RR) is a\r\ngood example of a zone's version, and it is the only one defined by\r\nthis specification.  Additional version types may be defined by\r\nfuture specifications.\r\n\r\nIncluding zone version data in a response simplifies and improves the\r\nquality of debugging and diagnostics since the version and the DNS\r\nanswer are provided atomically.  This can be especially useful for\r\nzones and DNS providers that leverage IP anycast or multiple backend\r\nsystems.  It functions similarly to the DNS Name Server Identifier\r\n(NSID) option described in RFC 5001.","pub_date":"October 2024","keywords":["zoneversion"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9660","errata_url":null}
