That combination is what we refer to as \"PBB-EVPN.\"\r\nSingle-Active multihoming and per Service Instance Identifier (I-SID)\r\nload-balancing can be provided to access devices and aggregation\r\nnetworks. In order to speed up the network convergence in case of\r\nfailures on Single-Active multihomed Ethernet Segments (ESs),\r\nPBB-EVPN defines a flush mechanism for Customer MACs (C-MACs) called\r\n\"C-MAC flush\" that works for different Ethernet Segment Backbone MAC\r\n(B-MAC) address allocation models. This document complements those\r\nC-MAC flush procedures for cases in which no PBB-EVPN ESs are defined\r\n(i.e., the attachment circuit is associated with a zero Ethernet\r\nSegment Identifier (ESI)) and the C-MAC flush requires I-SID-level\r\ngranularity.","pub_date":"March 2024","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9541","errata_url":null}
