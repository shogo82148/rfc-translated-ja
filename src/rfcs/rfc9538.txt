  Content Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Delegation Using the
              Automated Certificate Management Environment

Abstract

   This document defines metadata to support delegating the delivery of
   HTTPS content between two or more interconnected Content Delivery
   Networks (CDNs).  Specifically, this document defines a Content
   Delivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Metadata interface object to
   enable delegation of X.509 certificates leveraging delegation schemes
   defined in RFC 9115.  Per RFC 9115, delegating entities can remain in
   full control of the delegation and can revoke it at any time.  This
   avoids the need to share private cryptographic key material between
   the involved entities.

1.  Introduction

   Content delivery over HTTPS using two or more cooperating CDNs along
   the path requires credential management, specifically when DNS-based
   redirection is used.  In such cases, an upstream CDN (uCDN) needs to
   delegate its credentials to a downstream CDN (dCDN) for content
   delivery.

   [RFC9115] defines delegation methods that allow a uCDN on behalf of
   the content provider, the holder of the domain, to generate on-demand
   an X.509 certificate that binds the designated domain name with a key
   pair owned by the dCDN.  For further details, please refer to
   Sections 1 and 5.1.2.1 of [RFC9115].

   This document defines CDNI Metadata to make use of HTTPS delegation
   between a uCDN and a dCDN based on the mechanism specified in
   [RFC9115].  Furthermore, it adds a delegation method to the "CDNI
   Payload Types" IANA registry.

   Section 2 presents delegation metadata for the Footprint &
   Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI).  Section 3 addresses the
   metadata for handling HTTPS delegation with the Metadata interface.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses terminology from CDNI framework documents such as:
   CDNI framework document [RFC7336] and CDNI interface specifications
   documents: CDNI Metadata interface [RFC8006] and CDNI Footprint and
   Capabilities Advertisement interface [RFC8008].  It also uses
   terminology from Section 1.2 of [RFC8739] and Section 1.1 of
   [RFC9115], including Short-Term, Automatically Renewed (STAR), as
   applied to X.509 certificates.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Advertising Delegation Metadata for CDNI through FCI

   The Footprint & Capabilities Advertisement interface (FCI) defined in
   [RFC8008] allows a dCDN to send a FCI capability type object to a
   uCDN.

   This document uses the CDNI Metadata capability object serialization
   from [RFC8008] for a CDN that supports delegation methods.

   The following is an example of the supported delegated methods
   capability object for a dCDN implementing the ACME delegation method.

   {
     "capabilities": [
       {
         "capability-type": "FCI.Metadata",
         "capability-value": {
           "metadata": [
             // list of supported delegation methods
             "ACMEDelegationMethod"
           ]
         },
         "footprints": [
           "Footprint objects"
         ]
       }
     ]
   }

3.  ACME Delegation Metadata for CDNI

   When a uCDN delegates the delivery of HTTPS traffic to a dCDN using
   DNS redirection [RFC7336], the dCDN must use a certificate bound to
   the origin's name to successfully authenticate to the end-user (see
   also Section 5.1.2.1 of [RFC9115]).

   To that end, this section defines the AcmeDelegationMethod object,
   which describes metadata for using the ACME delegation interface
   [RFC9115].

   The ACMEDelegationMethod applies to both ACME STAR delegation, which
   provides a delegation model based on short-term certificates with
   automatic renewal (Section 2.3.2 of [RFC9115]), and non-STAR
   delegation, which allows delegation between CDNs using long-term
   certificates (Section 2.3.3 of [RFC9115]).

   Figure 1 provides a high-level view of the combined CDNI and ACME
   delegation message flows to obtain a STAR certificate from the
   Certification Authority (CA) bound to the Content Provider's (CP)
   name.

    Figure 1: Example Call Flow of STAR Delegation in CDNI Showing
                       Two Levels of Delegation

      |  Note: The delegation object defined in Section 2.3.1.3 of
      |  [RFC9115] only allows DNS mappings to be specified using CNAME
      |  RRs.  A future document updating [RFC9115] could expand the
      |  delegation object to also include SVCB/HTTPS-based mappings
      |  [RFC9460].

   Section 3.1 defines the objects used for bootstrapping the ACME
   delegation method between a uCDN and a delegate dCDN.

3.1.  ACMEDelegationMethod Object

   The ACMEDelegationMethod object allows a uCDN to define both STAR and
   non-STAR delegations.  The dCDN, the consumer of the delegation, can
   determine the type of delegation by the presence (or absence) of the
   "lifetime" property.  That is, the presence of the "lifetime"
   property explicitly means a short-term delegation with lifetime of
   the certificate based on that property (and the optional "lifetime-
   adjust" attribute).  A non-STAR delegation will not have the
   "lifetime" property in the delegation.  See also the examples in
   Section 3.1.1.

   The ACMEDelegationMethod object is defined with the properties shown
   below.

   *  Property: acme-delegation

      -  Description: A URL pointing at an ACME delegation object,
         either STAR or non-STAR, associated with the dCDN account on
         the uCDN ACME server (see Section 2.3.1.3 of [RFC9115] for the
         details).  The URL MUST use the https scheme.

      -  Type: String

      -  Mandatory-to-Specify: Yes

   *  Property: time-window

      -  Description: Validity period of the certificate.  According to
         Section 4.3.4 of [RFC8006], a TimeWindow object is defined by a
         window "start" time and a window "end" time.  In the case of a
         STAR method, the "start" and "end" properties of the window
         MUST be understood respectively as the start-date and end-date
         of the certificate validity.  In the case of a non-STAR method,
         the "start" and "end" properties of the window MUST be
         understood, respectively, as the notBefore and notAfter fields
         of the certificate.

      -  Type: TimeWindow

      -  Mandatory-to-Specify: Yes

   *  Property: lifetime

      -  Description: See lifetime in Section 3.1.1 of [RFC8739]

      -  Type: Integer

      -  Mandatory-to-Specify: Yes, only if a STAR delegation method is
         specified

   *  Property: lifetime-adjust

      -  Description: See lifetime-adjust in Section 3.1.1 of [RFC8739]

      -  Type: Integer

      -  Mandatory-to-Specify: No

3.1.1.  Examples

   The following example shows an ACMEDelegationMethod object for a
   STAR-based ACME delegation.

   {
     "generic-metadata-type": "MI.ACMEDelegationMethod",
     "generic-metadata-value": {
       "acme-delegation": "https://acme.ucdn.example/delegation/ogfr",
       "time-window": {
         "start": 1665417434,
         "end": 1665676634
       },
       "lifetime": 345600,
       "lifetime-adjust": 259200
     }
   }

   The example below shows an ACMEDelegationMethod object for a non-STAR
   ACME delegation.  The delegation object is defined as per Section 4.3
   of [RFC8006].

   {
     "generic-metadata-type": "MI.ACMEDelegationMethod",
     "generic-metadata-value": {
       "acme-delegation": "https://acme.ucdn.example/delegation/wSi5",
       "time-window": {
         "start": 1570982234,
         "end": 1665417434
       }
     }
   }

4.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, the following type has been registered in the
   "CDNI Payload Types" registry:

                  +=========================+===========+
                  | Payload Type            | Reference |
                  +=========================+===========+
                  | MI.ACMEDelegationMethod | RFC 9538  |
                  +-------------------------+-----------+

                                  Table 1

4.1.  CDNI MI ACMEDelegationMethod Payload Type

   Purpose:  The purpose of this Payload Type is to distinguish
      AcmeDelegationMethod MI objects (and any associated capability
      advertisement)

   Interface:  MI/FCI

   Encoding:  See Section 3.1

5.  Security Considerations

   The metadata object defined in this document does not introduce any
   new security or privacy concerns over those already discussed in
   [RFC9115], [RFC8006], and [RFC8008].

   The reader is expected to understand the ACME delegation trust model
   (Section 7.1 of [RFC9115]) and security goal (Section 7.2 of
   [RFC9115]).  In particular, the reader is expected to understand that
   it is critical to protect the user account associated with the
   delegation; this account authorizes all the security-relevant
   operations between a dCDN and a uCDN over the ACME channel.  The
   dCDN's ACME account is also relevant to the privacy of the entire
   scheme; for example, the acme-delegation resource in the Metadata
   object is only accessible to the holder of the account key, who is
   allowed to fetch its content exclusively via POST-as-GET
   (Section 2.3.1.2 of [RFC9115]).

   In addition, the Metadata interface authentication and
   confidentiality requirements defined in Section 8 of [RFC8006] MUST
   be followed.

   Implementers MUST adhere to the security considerations defined in
   Section 7 of [RFC8008], "Content Delivery Network Interconnection
   (CDNI) Request Routing: Footprint and Capabilities Semantics".

   When TLS is used to achieve the above security objectives, the
   general TLS usage guidance in [RFC9325] MUST be followed.
