This is achieved by profiling\r\nthe Certificate Management Protocol (CMP), the related Certificate\r\nRequest Message Format (CRMF), and transfer based on HTTP or\r\nConstrained Application Protocol (CoAP) in a succinct but\r\nsufficiently detailed and self-contained way.  To make secure\r\ncertificate management for simple scenarios and constrained devices\r\nas lightweight as possible, only the most crucial types of operations\r\nand options are specified as mandatory.  More specialized or complex\r\nuse cases are supported with optional features.","pub_date":"November 2023","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9483","errata_url":null}
