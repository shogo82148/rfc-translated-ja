These\r\nmethods employ just a few marking bits inside the header of each\r\npacket for performance measurements and require the client and server\r\nto collaborate. Both endpoints cooperate by marking packets and,\r\npossibly, mirroring the markings on the round-trip connection. The\r\ntechniques are especially valuable when applied to protocols that\r\nencrypt transport headers since they enable loss and delay\r\nmeasurements by passive, on-path network devices. This document\r\ndescribes several methods that can be used separately or jointly\r\ndepending of the availability of marking bits, desired measurements,\r\nand properties of the protocol to which the methods are applied.","pub_date":"October 2023","keywords":["Performance","Monitoring","Passive","Hybrid","Loss","Delay","Client","Server","On-path","Observer","Probe","Alternate","Marking","Round","Trip","Latency","Encrypted","Protocol","Bits"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9506","errata_url":null}
