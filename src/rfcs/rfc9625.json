Each segment may be located at a different site,\r\nand the segments are interconnected by an IP or MPLS backbone. \r\nIntra-subnet traffic (either unicast or multicast) always appears to\r\nthe end users to be bridged, even when it is actually carried over\r\nthe IP or MPLS backbone.  When a single tenant owns multiple such\r\nLANs, EVPN also allows IP unicast traffic to be routed between those\r\nLANs.  This document specifies new procedures that allow inter-subnet\r\nIP multicast traffic to be routed among the LANs of a given tenant\r\nwhile still making intra-subnet IP multicast traffic appear to be\r\nbridged.  These procedures can provide optimal routing of the\r\ninter-subnet multicast traffic and do not require any such traffic to\r\negress a given router and then ingress that same router.  These\r\nprocedures also accommodate IP multicast traffic that originates or\r\nis destined to be external to the EVPN domain.","pub_date":"August 2024","keywords":["OISM","PEG","MEG","SBD"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9625","errata_url":null}
