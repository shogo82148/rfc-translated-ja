This document\r\ndescribes an extension to the MPLS Label Switched Path (LSP) echo\r\nrequest that allows a BFD system to request that the remote BFD peer\r\ntransmit BFD control packets over the specified LSP.","pub_date":"July 2024","keywords":["LSP Ping","BFD"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9612","errata_url":null}
