      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">In TCP/IP, routing and forwarding are based on IP addresses. To ascertain
      the route to an IP address and to measure the transit delays, the traceroute
      utility is commonly used. In Information-Centric Networking (ICN), routing and forwarding are based on name prefixes.
      To this end, the ability to ascertain the characteristics of at least one of
      the available routes to a name prefix is a fundamental requirement for
      instrumentation and network management. These characteristics include, among
      others, route properties such as which forwarders were transited and the
      delay incurred through forwarding.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">In order to carry out meaningful experimentation and deployment of ICN protocols, new tools analogous to ping and traceroute used for TCP/IP are needed to manage and debug the operation of ICN architectures and protocols. This document describes the design of a management and debugging protocol analogous to the traceroute protocol of TCP/IP; this new management and debugging protocol will aid the experimental deployment of ICN protocols. As the community continues its experimentation with ICN architectures and protocols, the design of ICN Traceroute might change accordingly. ICN Traceroute is designed as a tool to troubleshoot ICN architectures and protocols. As such, this document is classified as an Experimental RFC.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-1">In IP-based networks, traceroute is based on the expiration of the Time To Live (TTL) IP header field. Specifically, a traceroute client sends consecutive packets (depending on the implementation and the user-specified behavior, such packets can be either UDP datagrams, ICMP Echo Request packets, or TCP SYN packets) with a TTL value increased by 1, essentially performing an expanding ring search. In this way, the first IP packet sent will expire at the first router along the path, the second IP packet at the second router along the path, etc., until the router (or host) with the specified destination IP address is reached. Each router along the path towards the destination responds by sending back an ICMP Time Exceeded packet, unless explicitly prevented from doing so by a security policy.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-2">The IP-based traceroute utility operates on IP addresses and in particular
      depends on the IP packets having source IP addresses that are used as
      the destination address for replies. Given that ICN forwards based on names
      rather than destination IP addresses, that the names do not
      refer to unique endpoints (multi-destination), and that the packets
      do not contain source addresses, a substantially different approach is needed.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-1"> In the Named Data Networking (NDN) and Content-Centric Networking (CCNx)
      protocols, the communication paradigm is based exclusively on named
      objects. An Interest message is forwarded across the network based on its name.
      Eventually, it retrieves a Content Object from either a producer
      application or some forwarder's Content Store (CS).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-2">An ICN network differs from an IP network in at least four important ways (four of which are as follows):</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-3-3">
        <li pn="section-3-3.1">IP identifies interfaces to an IP network with a fixed-length address and delivers IP packets to one or more interfaces. ICN identifies units of data in the network with a variable-length name consisting of a hierarchical list of segments.</li>
        <li pn="section-3-3.2">An IP-based network depends on the IP packets having source IP
addresses that are used as the destination address for replies. On the other hand, ICN Interests do not have source addresses, and they are forwarded based on names, which do not refer to a unique endpoint. Data packets follow the reverse path of the Interests based on hop-by-hop state created during Interest forwarding.</li>
        <li pn="section-3-3.3">An IP network supports multi-path, single-destination, stateless packet forwarding and delivery via unicast; a limited form of multi-destination selected delivery with anycast; and group-based multi-destination delivery via multicast. In contrast, ICN supports multi-path and multi-destination stateful Interest forwarding and multi-destination data delivery to units of named data.  This single forwarding semantic subsumes the functions of unicast, anycast, and
multicast.  As a result, consecutive (or retransmitted) ICN Interest messages may be forwarded through an ICN network along different paths and may be forwarded to different data sources (e.g., end-node applications, in-network storage) holding a copy of the requested unit of data. The ability to discover multiple available (or
potentially all) paths towards a name prefix is a desirable capability for an ICN Traceroute protocol, since it can be beneficial for congestion control purposes. Knowing the number of available paths for a name can also be useful in cases where Interest forwarding based on application semantics/preferences is desirable.</li>
        <li pn="section-3-3.4">In the case of multiple Interests with the same name arriving at a forwarder, a number of Interests may be aggregated in a common Pending Interest Table (PIT) entry. Depending on the lifetime of a PIT entry, the round-trip time of an Interest-Data exchange might vary significantly (e.g., it might be shorter than the full round-trip time to reach the original content producer). To this end, the round-trip time experienced by consumers might also vary even under constant network load.</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-4">These differences introduce new challenges, new opportunities, and new
      requirements regarding the design of ICN Traceroute. Following this communication
      model, a traceroute client should be able to express traceroute requests
      directed to a name prefix and receive responses.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-9">In order to provide stable and reliable diagnostics, it is desirable that the
      packet encoding of a traceroute request enable the forwarders to distinguish this request from a normal Interest while also diverging as little as possible from the forwarding behavior for an Interest packet. In the same way, the encoding of a traceroute reply should minimize any processing differences from those employed for a data packet by the forwarders.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-10">The term "traceroute session" is used for an iterative process during which an endpoint client application generates a number of traceroute requests to successively traverse more distant hops in the path until it receives a final traceroute reply from a forwarder. It is desirable that ICN Traceroute be able to discover a number of paths towards the expressed prefix within the same session or subsequent sessions. To discover all the hops in a path, we need a mechanism (Interest Steering) to steer requests along different paths. Such a capability was initially published in  <xref target="PATHSTEERING" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="PATHSTEERING"/> and has been specified for CCNx and NDN in <xref target="RFC9531" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9531"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-11">In the case of traceroute requests for the same prefix from different sources, it is also important to have a mechanism to avoid aggregating those requests in the PIT. To this end, we need some encoding in the traceroute requests
to make each request for a common prefix unique, hence avoiding PIT aggregation
and further enabling the exact matching of a response with a particular traceroute packet.</t>

InterestReturn indicating "No Route" in the case of CCNx or a network NACK in the case of NDN is sent downstream.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-1">In this section, we elaborate on two alternative design approaches in cases where the traceroute target prefix corresponds to a locally scoped namespace not directly routable from the client's local network.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-2">The first approach leverages the NDN Link Object <xref target="SNAMP" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="SNAMP"/>. Specifically, the traceroute client attaches to the expressed request a Link Object that contains a number of routable name prefixes, based on which the request can be forwarded across the Internet until it reaches a network region where the request name itself is routable. A Link Object is created and signed by a data producer allowed to publish data under a locally scoped namespace. The way that a client retrieves a Link Object depends on various network design factors and is out of scope for this document.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-3"> At the time of this writing, and based on the current deployment of
the Link Object by the NDN team <xref target="NDNLPv2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="NDNLPv2"/>, a forwarder at the border
of the region where an Interest name becomes routable has to remove
the Link Object from the incoming Interests.
The Interest state maintained along the entire forwarding path is based on the Interest name regardless of whether it was forwarded based on this name or a prefix in the Link Object.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-4">The second approach is based on prepending a routable prefix to the locally scoped name. The resulting prefix will be the name of the traceroute requests expressed by the client. In this way, a request will be forwarded based on the routable part of its name. When it reaches the network region where the original locally scoped name is routable, the border forwarder rewrites the request name and deletes its routable part. A forwarder will perform this rewriting operation on a request if the following two conditions are met:</t>
      <ol type="%d)" indent="adaptive" spacing="normal" start="1" pn="section-7-5">
      	<li pn="section-7-5.1" derivedCounter="1)">the routable part of the request name matches a routable name of the network region adjacent to the forwarder (assuming that a forwarder is aware of those names), and </li>
        <li pn="section-7-5.2" derivedCounter="2)">the remaining part of the request name is routable across the network
region of this forwarder.</li>
      </ol>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-6">The state along the path depends on whether the request is traversing the portion of the network where the locally scoped name is routable. In this case, the forwarding can be based entirely on the locally scoped name. However, where a portion of the path lies outside the region where the locally scoped name is routable, the border router has to rewrite the name of a reply and prepend the routable prefix of the corresponding request to ensure that the generated replies will reach the client.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-1">A reflection attack could occur in the case of a traceroute reply with the CCNx packet format  if a compromised forwarder includes in the reply the name of a victim forwarder.  This could redirect the future administrative traffic towards the victim. To foil such reflection attacks, the forwarder that generates a traceroute reply <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> sign the name included in the payload. In this way, the client is able to verify that the included name is legitimate and refers to the forwarder that generated the reply. Alternatively, the forwarder could include in the reply payload their routable prefix(es) encoded as a signed NDN Link Object <xref target="SNAMP" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="SNAMP"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-2">This approach does not protect against on-path attacks where a compromised forwarder that receives a traceroute reply replaces the forwarder's name and the signature in the message with its own name and signature to make the client believe that the reply was generated by the compromised forwarder. To foil such attack scenarios, a forwarder can sign the reply message itself. In such cases, the forwarder does not have to sign its own name in the reply message, since the message signature protects the message as a whole and will be invalidated in the case of an on-path attack. Additionally, a forwarder could swap out the name of a traceroute request with a name of its choosing. In this case, however, the response with the spoofed name will not be received by a client, since the change of name would invalidate the state in the PIT on the path back to the client.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-3">Signing each traceroute reply message can be expensive and can potentially lead to computation attacks against forwarders. To mitigate such attack scenarios, the processing of traceroute requests and the generation of the replies <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be handled by a separate management
      application running locally on each forwarder. The serving of traceroute replies is thereby separated from load on the forwarder itself. The approaches used by ICN applications to manage load may also apply to the
      forwarder's  management application.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-4">Interest flooding attack amplification is possible in the case of the second approach for dealing with locally scoped namespaces as described in <xref target="local" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7"/>. A border forwarder will have to maintain extra state to prepend the correct routable prefix to the name of an outgoing reply, since the forwarder might be attached to multiple network regions (reachable under different prefixes) or a network region attached to this forwarder might be reachable under multiple routable prefixes.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-5">We also note that traceroute requests have the same privacy characteristics as regular Interests.</t>

            <abstract>
              <t indent="0">This document describes a mechanism named "CCNinfo" that discovers information about the network topology and in-network cache in Content-Centric Networks (CCNs). CCNinfo investigates 1) the CCN routing path information per name prefix, 2) the Round-Trip Time (RTT) between the content forwarder and the consumer, and 3) the states of in-network cache per name prefix. CCNinfo is useful to understand and debug the behavior of testbed networks and other experimental deployments of CCN systems.</t>

      <name slugifiedName="name-traceroute-client-applicati">Traceroute Client Application (Consumer) Operation</name>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-1">This section is an informative appendix regarding the proposed traceroute client operation.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-2">The client application is responsible for generating traceroute requests for prefixes provided by users.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-3">The overall process can be iterative: the first traceroute request of each session will have a HopLimit of 1 to reach the first hop forwarder, the second request will have a HopLimit of 2 to reach the second hop forwarder, and so on.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-4">When generating a series of requests for a specific name, the first
       request will typically not include a Path Label TLV, since no TLV value
       is known. After a traceroute reply containing a Path Label TLV is received, each subsequent request might include the received path steering value in the Path Label header TLV to drive the requests towards a common path as part of checking network performance. To discover more paths, a client can omit the Path Label TLV in future requests. Moreover, for each new traceroute request, the client has to generate a new nonce and record the time that the request was expressed.
The client also sets the lifetime of the traceroute request, which carries the same semantics as the Interest Lifetime <xref target="RFC8609" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8609"/> in an Interest.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-5">Moreover, the client application might not wish to receive replies due to CS hits. In CCNx, a mechanism to achieve that would be to use a Content Object Hash Restriction TLV with a value of 0 in the payload of a traceroute request message. In NDN, the exclude filter selector can be used.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-6">When it receives a traceroute reply, the client would typically match the reply to a sent request and compute the round-trip time of the request. It should parse the Path Label value and decode the reply's payload to parse the sender's name and signature. The client should verify that both the received message and the forwarder's name have been signed by the key of the forwarder, whose name is included in the payload of the reply (by fetching this forwarder's public key and verifying the contained signature). In the case that the client receives a PT_TR_REPLY Code TLV with a valid value, it can stop sending requests with increasing HopLimit values and potentially start a new traceroute session.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a-7">In the case that a traceroute reply is not received for a request within a certain time interval (lifetime of the request), the client should time out and send a new request with a new nonce value up to a maximum number of requests to be sent specified by the user.</t>
