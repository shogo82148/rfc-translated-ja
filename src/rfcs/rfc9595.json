SIDs provide a more\r\ncompact method for identifying those YANG items that can be used\r\nefficiently, notably in constrained environments (RFC 7228). This\r\ndocument defines the semantics, registration processes, and\r\nassignment processes for YANG SIDs for IETF-managed YANG modules. To\r\nenable the implementation of these processes, this document also\r\ndefines a file format used to persist and publish assigned YANG SIDs.","pub_date":"July 2024","keywords":["CBOR"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9595","errata_url":null}
