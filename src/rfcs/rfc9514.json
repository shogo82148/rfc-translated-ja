The BGP-LS address-family solution for SRv6\r\ndescribed in this document is similar to BGP-LS for SR for the MPLS\r\ndata plane, which is defined in RFC 9085.","pub_date":"December 2023","keywords":["BGP","BGP-LS","Segment Routing","SRv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9514","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9514"}
