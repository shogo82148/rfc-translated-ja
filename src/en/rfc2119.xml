    <abstract>
 <t>In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:</t>
    <blockquote>
    <t>The key words "<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>", "<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>", "<bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHALL</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14>",
"<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>", "<bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>", "<bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>", "<bcp14>MAY</bcp14>", and "<bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</t>
    </blockquote>
    <t>Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.</t>

    <section anchor="must" numbered="true" toc="default" pn="section-1">
      <name slugifiedName="name-msut">MUST</name>
      <t>This word, or the terms "<bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>" or "<bcp14>SHALL</bcp14>", mean that the
definition is an absolute requirement of the specification.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="must-not" numbered="true" toc="default" pn="section-2">
      <name slugifiedName="name-must-not">MUST NOT</name>
      <t> This phrase, or the phrase "<bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14>", mean that the
definition is an absolute prohibition of the specification.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="should" numbered="true" toc="default" pn="section-3">
      <name slugifiedName="name-should">SHOULD</name>
      <t>This word, or the adjective "<bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>", mean that there
may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a
particular item, but the full implications must be understood and
carefully weighed before choosing a different course.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="should-not" numbered="true" toc="default" pn="section-4">
      <name slugifiedName="name-should-not">SHOULD NOT</name>
      <t>This phrase, or the phrase "<bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14>" mean that
there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances when the
particular behavior is acceptable or even useful, but the full
implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed
before implementing any behavior described with this label.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="may" numbered="true" toc="default" pn="section-5">
      <name slugifiedName="name-may">MAY</name>
      <t>This word, or the adjective "<bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>", mean that an item is
truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a
particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that
it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item.
An implementation which does not include a particular option <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does
include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the
same vein an implementation which does include a particular option
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which
does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the
option provides.)</t>

    <section anchor="guidance" numbered="true" toc="default" pn="section-6">
      <name slugifiedName="name-guidance">Guidance in the use of these Imperatives</name>
      <t>Imperatives of the type defined in this memo must be used with care
and sparingly.  In particular, they <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only be used where it is
actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has
potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting retransmisssions)  For
example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method
on implementors where the method is not required for
interoperability.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="security-considerations" numbered="true" toc="default" pn="section-7">
      <name slugifiedName="name-security-considerations">Security Considerations</name>
      <t>These terms are frequently used to specify behavior with security
implications.  The effects on security of not implementing a <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> or
<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>, or doing something the specification says <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> or <bcp14>SHOULD
NOT</bcp14> be done may be very subtle. Document authors should take the time
to elaborate the security implications of not following
recommendations or requirements as most implementors will not have
had the benefit of the experience and discussion that produced the
specification.</t>

    <section anchor="acknowledgments" numbered="true" toc="default" pn="section-8">
      <name slugifiedName="name-acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</name>
      <t>The definitions of these terms are an amalgam of definitions taken
   from a number of RFCs.  In addition, suggestions have been
   incorporated from a number of people including Robert Ullmann, Thomas
   Narten, Neal McBurnett, and Robert Elz.</t>
