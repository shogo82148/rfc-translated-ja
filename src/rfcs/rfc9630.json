While IOAM is\r\nadvantageous for multicast traffic telemetry, some unique challenges\r\nare present.  This document provides the solutions based on the IOAM\r\ntrace option and direct export option to support the telemetry data\r\ncorrelation and the multicast tree reconstruction without incurring\r\ndata redundancy.","pub_date":"August 2024","keywords":["Multicast","Telemetry"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9630","errata_url":null}
