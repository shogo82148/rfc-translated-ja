This document describes a\r\nmethod of extending the performance measurements (specified in RFC\r\n6374) from flows carried over MPLS-TP to flows carried over generic\r\nMPLS LSPs.  In particular, it extends the technique to allow loss and\r\ndelay measurements to be made on multipoint-to-point LSPs and\r\nintroduces some additional techniques to allow more sophisticated\r\nmeasurements to be made in both MPLS-TP and generic MPLS networks.","pub_date":"May 2024","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9571","errata_url":null}
