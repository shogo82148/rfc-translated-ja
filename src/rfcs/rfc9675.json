The unique characteristics of this environment\r\nrequire a unique approach to network management that supports\r\nasynchronous transport, autonomous local control, and a small\r\nfootprint (in both resources and dependencies) so as to deploy on\r\nconstrained devices. \r\n\r\nThis document describes a DTN Management Architecture (DTNMA)\r\nsuitable for managing devices in any challenged environment but, in\r\nparticular, those communicating using the DTN Bundle Protocol (BP).\r\nOperating over BP requires an architecture that neither presumes\r\nsynchronized transport behavior nor relies on query-response\r\nmechanisms. Implementations compliant with this DTNMA should expect\r\nto successfully operate in extremely challenging conditions, such as\r\nover unidirectional links and other places where BP is the preferred\r\ntransport.","pub_date":"November 2024","keywords":["DTN","Network Management"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9675","errata_url":null}
