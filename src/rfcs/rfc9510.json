When using CCNx in environments with constrained nodes or\r\nbandwidth constrained networks, it is valuable to have a compressed\r\nrepresentation of delta time. In order to do so, either accuracy or\r\ndynamic range has to be sacrificed. Since the current uses of delta\r\ntime do not require both simultaneously, one can consider a\r\nlogarithmic encoding.
