The Flexible Algorithm (FA) is\r\nanother mechanism for creating a sub-topology within a topology using\r\ndefined topology constraints and computation algorithms. In order to\r\ndeploy Multipoint LDP (mLDP) in a network that supports MTR, FA, or\r\nother methods of signaling non-default IGP Algorithms (IPAs), mLDP is\r\nrequired to become topology and algorithm aware.  This document\r\nspecifies extensions to mLDP to support the use of MTR\/IPAs such\r\nthat, when building multipoint Label Switched Paths (LSPs), the LSPs\r\ncan follow a particular topology and algorithm. This document updates\r\nRFC 7307 by allocating eight bits from a previously reserved field to\r\nbe used as the \"IPA\" field.","pub_date":"October 2024","keywords":["MPLS","mLDP","Multi-topology"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC7307"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9658","errata_url":null}
