      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">This document describes the principles of traffic engineering (TE) in
      the Internet.  The document is intended to promote better understanding
      of the issues surrounding traffic engineering in IP networks and the
      networks that support IP networking and to provide a common basis for
      the development of traffic-engineering capabilities for the Internet.
      The principles, architectures, and methodologies for performance
      evaluation and performance optimization of operational networks are also
      discussed.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-2">This work was first published as RFC 3272 in May 2002.  This document
      obsoletes RFC 3272 by making a complete update to bring the text in line
      with best current practices for Internet traffic engineering and to
      include references to the latest relevant work in the IETF.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">This document describes the principles of Internet traffic
      engineering (TE).  The objective of the document is to articulate the
      general issues and principles for Internet TE and, where appropriate, to
      provide recommendations, guidelines, and options for the development of
      preplanned (offline) and dynamic (online) Internet TE capabilities and
      support systems.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">Even though Internet TE is most effective when applied end-to-end,
      the focus of this document is TE within a given domain (such as an
      Autonomous System (AS)).  However, because a preponderance of Internet
      traffic tends to originate in one AS and terminate in
      another, this document also provides an overview of aspects pertaining
      to inter-domain TE.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">This document provides terminology and a taxonomy for describing and
     understanding common Internet TE concepts.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">This work was first published as <xref target="RFC3272" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3272"/> in May 2002.  This document obsoletes <xref target="RFC3272" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3272"/> by making a complete update to bring
      the text in line with best current practices for Internet TE and to

        <name slugifiedName="name-what-is-internet-traffic-en">What is Internet Traffic Engineering?</name>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-1">One of the most significant functions performed in the Internet is
        the routing and forwarding of traffic from ingress nodes to egress
        nodes.  Therefore, one of the most distinctive functions performed by
        Internet traffic engineering is the control and optimization of these
        routing and forwarding functions, to steer traffic through the
        network.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-2">Internet traffic engineering is defined as that aspect of Internet
        network engineering dealing with the issues of performance evaluation
        and performance optimization of operational IP networks.  Traffic
        engineering encompasses the application of technology and scientific
        principles to the measurement, characterization, modeling, and control
        of Internet traffic <xref target="RFC2702" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2702"/> <xref target="AWD2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="AWD2"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-3">It is the performance of the network as seen by end users of
        network services that is paramount.  The characteristics visible to
        end users are the emergent properties of the network, which are the
        characteristics of the network when viewed as a whole.  A central goal
        of the service provider, therefore, is to enhance the emergent
        properties of the network while taking economic considerations into
        account.  This is accomplished by addressing traffic-oriented
        performance requirements while utilizing network resources without
        excessive waste and in a reliable way.  Traffic-oriented performance
        measures include delay, delay variation, packet loss, and
        throughput.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-4">Internet TE responds to network events (such as link or node
        failures, reported or predicted network congestion, planned
        maintenance, service degradation, planned changes in the traffic
        matrix, etc.).  Aspects of capacity management respond at intervals
        ranging from days to years.  Routing control functions operate at
        intervals ranging from milliseconds to days.  Packet-level processing
        functions operate at very fine levels of temporal resolution (up to
        milliseconds) while reacting to statistical measures of the real-time
        behavior of traffic.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-5">Thus, the optimization aspects of TE can be viewed from a control
        perspective and can be both proactive and reactive.  In the proactive
        case, the TE control system takes preventive action to protect against
        predicted unfavorable future network states, for example, by
        engineering backup paths.  
It may also take action that will lead to a
        more desirable future network state.  In the reactive case, the
        control system responds to correct issues and adapt to network
        events, such as routing after failure.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-6">Another important objective of Internet TE is to facilitate
        reliable network operations <xref target="RFC2702" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2702"/>.
        Reliable network operations can be facilitated by providing mechanisms
        that enhance network integrity and by embracing policies emphasizing
        network survivability.  This reduces the vulnerability of services to
        outages arising from errors, faults, and failures occurring within the
        network infrastructure.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-7">The optimization aspects of TE can be achieved
       through capacity management and traffic management.  In this
       document, capacity management includes capacity planning, routing
       control, and resource management.  Network resources of particular
       interest include link bandwidth, buffer space, and computational
       resources.  In this document, traffic management includes:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" indent="adaptive" start="1" type="1" pn="section-1.1-8">
	  <li pn="section-1.1-8.1" derivedCounter="1.">Nodal traffic control functions, such as traffic conditioning,
	  queue management, and scheduling.</li>
          <li pn="section-1.1-8.2" derivedCounter="2.">Other functions that regulate the flow of traffic through
          the network or that arbitrate access to network resources between
          different packets or between different traffic flows.</li>
        </ol>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-9">One major challenge of Internet TE is the realization of automated
        control capabilities that adapt quickly and cost-effectively to
        significant changes in network state, while still maintaining
        stability of the network.  Performance evaluation can assess the
        effectiveness of TE methods, and the results of this evaluation can be
        used to identify existing problems, guide network reoptimization, and
        aid in the prediction of potential future problems.  However, this
        process can also be time-consuming and may not be suitable to act on
        short-lived changes in the network.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-10">Performance evaluation can be achieved in many different ways.  The
       most notable techniques include analytic methods, simulation, and
       empirical methods based on measurements.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-11">Traffic engineering comes in two flavors:
        </t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-1.1-12">
          <li pn="section-1.1-12.1">A background process that constantly monitors traffic and
          network conditions and optimizes the use of resources to
          improve performance.</li>

          optimal.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-13">In the latter case, any deviation from the optimum distribution
        (e.g., caused by a fiber cut) is reverted upon repair without further
        optimization.  However, this form of TE relies upon the notion that
        the planned state of the network is optimal.  Hence,
        there are two levels of TE in such a mode: </t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-1.1-14">

          <li pn="section-1.1-14.2">The routing and forwarding tasks that keep traffic flows
	  attached to the pre-planned distribution.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.1-15">As a general rule, TE concepts and mechanisms must be sufficiently
        specific and well-defined to address known requirements but
        simultaneously flexible and extensible to accommodate
        unforeseen future demands (see <xref target="HIGHOBJ" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.1"/>).</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-1">As mentioned in <xref target="WHATTE" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 1.1"/>, Internet
        traffic engineering provides performance optimization of IP networks
        while utilizing network resources economically and reliably.  Such
        optimization is supported at the control/controller level and within
        the data/forwarding plane.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-2">The key elements required in any TE solution are as follows:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1" indent="adaptive" start="1" pn="section-1.2-3"><li pn="section-1.2-3.1" derivedCounter="1.">Policy</li>
          <li pn="section-1.2-3.2" derivedCounter="2.">Path steering</li>
          <li pn="section-1.2-3.3" derivedCounter="3.">Resource management</li>
        </ol>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-4">Some TE solutions rely on these elements to a lesser or greater
        extent.  Debate remains about whether a solution can truly be
        called "TE" if it does not include all of these elements.  For the sake
        of this document, we assert that all TE solutions must include some
        aspects of all of these elements.  Other solutions can be classed as
        "partial TE" and also fall in scope of this document.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-5">Policy allows for the selection of paths (including next hops)
        based on information beyond basic reachability.  Early definitions of
        routing policy, e.g., <xref target="RFC1102" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1102"/> and
        <xref target="RFC1104" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1104"/>, discuss routing policy
        being applied to restrict access to network resources at an aggregate
        level.  BGP is an example of a commonly used mechanism for applying
        such policies; see <xref target="RFC4271" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4271"/> and <xref target="RFC8955" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8955"/>.  In the TE context, policy
        decisions are made within the control plane or by controllers in the
        management plane and govern the selection of paths.  Examples can be
        found in <xref target="RFC4655" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4655"/> and <xref target="RFC5394" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5394"/>.  TE solutions may cover the
        mechanisms to distribute and/or enforce policies, but definition of
        specific policies is left to the network operator.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-6">Path steering is the ability to forward packets using more
        information than just knowledge of the next hop.  Examples of path
        steering include IPv4 source routes <xref target="RFC0791" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC0791"/>, RSVP-TE explicit routes <xref target="RFC3209" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3209"/>, Segment Routing (SR) <xref target="RFC8402" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8402"/>, and Service Function Chaining <xref target="RFC7665" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7665"/>.  Path steering for TE can be
        supported via control plane protocols, by encoding in the data plane
        headers, or by a combination of the two.  This includes when control
        is provided by a controller using a network-facing control
        protocol.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-7">Resource management provides resource-aware control and forwarding.
        Examples of resources are bandwidth, buffers, and queues, all of which
        can be managed to control loss and latency.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-8">Resource reservation is the control aspect of resource management.
        It provides for domain-wide consensus about which network resources
        are used by a particular flow.  This determination may be made at a
        very coarse or very fine level.  Note that this consensus exists at
        the network control or controller level but not within the data plane.
        It may be composed purely of accounting/bookkeeping, but it typically
        includes an ability to admit, reject, or reclassify a flow based on
        policy. Such accounting can be done based on any combination of a
        static understanding of resource requirements and the use of dynamic
        mechanisms to collect requirements (e.g., via RSVP-TE <xref target="RFC3209" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3209"/>) and resource availability (e.g.,
        via OSPF extensions for GMPLS <xref target="RFC4203" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4203"/>).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-9">Resource allocation is the data plane aspect of resource
          management.  It provides for the allocation of specific node and
          link resources to specific flows.  Example resources include
          buffers, policing, and rate-shaping mechanisms that are typically
          supported via queuing.  Resource allocation also includes the matching of a flow (i.e.,
          flow classification) to a particular set of allocated resources.
          The method of flow classification and granularity of resource
          management is technology-specific. Examples include Diffserv with
          dropping and remarking <xref target="RFC4594" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4594"/>,
          MPLS-TE <xref target="RFC3209" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3209"/>, GMPLS-based Label
          Switched Paths (LSPs) <xref target="RFC3945" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3945"/>, as
          well as controller-based solutions <xref target="RFC8453" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8453"/>.  This level of resource control, while optional,
          is important in networks that wish to support network congestion
          management policies to control or regulate the offered traffic to
          deliver different levels of service and alleviate network
          congestion problems. It is also important in networks that wish to control the
          latency experienced by specific traffic flows.</t>

        practical level of TE technology that exists in the Internet at the
        time of writing.  That is, this document describes TE within a given
        AS in the Internet.  This document discusses concepts
        pertaining to intra-domain traffic control, including such issues as
        routing control, micro and macro resource allocation, and control
        coordination problems that arise consequently.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.3-2">This document describes and characterizes techniques already in use
        or in advanced development for Internet TE.  The way these techniques
        fit together is discussed and scenarios in which they are useful are
        identified.</t>

          the resource exceeds its output capacity over an interval of time.
          A small amount of congestion may be beneficial to ensure that
          network resources are run at full capacity, and this may be
          particularly true at the network edge where it is desirable to
          ensure that user traffic is served as much as possible.  Within the
          network, if congestion is allowed to build (such as when input
          traffic exceeds output traffic in a sustained way), it will have a

          <dd pn="section-1.4-2.18">This term is context-dependent and often applies to the life of
          a traffic flow from original source to final destination.
In contrast, edge-to-edge is often used to describe the traffic flow from the
entry of a domain or network to the exit of that domain or network.  However,
in some contexts (for example, where there is a service interface between a
network and the client of that network or where a path traverses multiple
domains under the control of a single process), end-to-end is used to refer to
the full operation of the service that may be composed of concatenated
edge-to-edge operations.  Thus, in the context of TE, the term "end-to-end"
may refer to the full TE path but not to the complete path of the traffic from
source application to ultimate destination.</dd>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.3-5">Still another class of problem is how to characterize the state of

         IP context.  A network element is said to be congested if it
         experiences sustained overload over an interval of time.  Although congestion
         at the edge of the network may be beneficial in ensuring that the network
         delivers as much traffic as possible, network congestion
         almost always results in degradation of service quality to end users.
         Congestion avoidance and response schemes can include demand-side policies and
         supply-side policies.  Demand-side policies may restrict access to
         congested resources or dynamically regulate the demand to alleviate
         the overload situation.  Supply-side policies may expand or augment
         network capacity to better accommodate offered traffic.  Supply-side
         policies may also reallocate network resources by redistributing
         traffic over the infrastructure.  Traffic redistribution and resource
         reallocation serve to increase the effective capacity of the network.</t>

                is filled), the RED scheme chooses arriving packets to "mark"
                according to a probabilistic algorithm that takes into account
                the average queue size.  A router that does not utilize
                Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3168"/> can simply drop marked packets to alleviate

                congestion.  On the other hand, if the router and the end
                hosts support ECN, they can set the ECN field in the packet
                header, and the end host can act on this information.  Several

                avoidance that is better than or equivalent to Tail-Drop (TD)
                queue management (drop arriving packets only when the queue is

                and improves fairness among different responsive traffic
                sessions.  However, RED by itself cannot prevent congestion

                long and medium timescales fall into this category.
                Preventive policies do not necessarily respond immediately to
                existing congestion problems.  Instead, forecasts of traffic
                demand and workload distribution are considered, and action
                may be taken to prevent potential future congestion problems.
                The schemes described for the short timescale can also be used
                for congestion avoidance because dropping or marking packets
                before queues actually overflow would trigger corresponding
                responsive traffic sources to slow down.  Preventive
                congestion management schemes may also be reactive.</li>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-1">Traffic-engineering methodologies can be classified as
        time-dependent, state-dependent, or event-dependent.  All TE schemes
        are considered to be dynamic in this document.  Static TE implies that
        no TE methodology or algorithm is being applied -- it is a feature of
        network planning but lacks the reactive and flexible nature of
        TE.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-2">In time-dependent TE, historical information based on periodic
        variations in traffic (such as time of day) is used to pre-program
        routing and other TE control mechanisms.  Additionally, customer
        subscription or traffic projection may be used.  Pre-programmed
        routing plans typically change on a relatively long timescale (e.g.,
        daily).  Time-dependent algorithms do not attempt to adapt to
        short-term variations in traffic or changing network conditions.  An
        example of a time-dependent algorithm is a centralized optimizer where
        the input to the system is a traffic matrix and multi-class QoS
        requirements as described in <xref target="MR99" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="MR99"/>.
        Another example of such a methodology is the application of data
        mining to Internet traffic <xref target="AJ19" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="AJ19"/>,
        which enables the use of various machine learning algorithms to
        identify patterns within historically collected datasets about
        Internet traffic and to extract information in order to guide
        decision-making and improve efficiency and productivity of
        operational processes.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-3">State-dependent TE adapts the routing plans based on the current
        state of the network, which provides additional information on
        variations in actual traffic (i.e., perturbations from regular
        variations) that could not be predicted using historical information.
        Constraint-based routing is an example of state-dependent TE operating
        in a relatively long timescale.  An example of operating in a
        relatively short timescale is a load-balancing algorithm described in
        <xref target="MATE" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="MATE"/>.  The state of the network can
        be based on parameters flooded by the routers.  Another approach is
        for a particular router performing adaptive TE to send probe packets
        along a path to gather the state of that path.  <xref target="RFC6374" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6374"/> defines protocol extensions to collect performance
        measurements from MPLS networks.  Another approach is for a management
        system to gather the relevant information directly from network
        elements using telemetry data collection publication/subscription
        techniques <xref target="RFC7923" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7923"/>.  Timely
        gathering and distribution of state information is critical for
        adaptive TE.  While time-dependent algorithms are suitable for
        predictable traffic variations, state-dependent algorithms may be
        needed to increase network efficiency and to provide resilience to
        adapt to changes in network state.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-4">Event-dependent TE methods can also be used for TE path selection.
	Event-dependent TE methods are distinct from time-dependent and
	state-dependent TE methods in the manner in which paths are selected.
	These algorithms are adaptive and distributed in nature, and they
	typically use learning models to find good paths for TE in a network.
	While state-dependent TE models typically use available-link-bandwidth
	(ALB) flooding <xref target="E.360.1" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="E.360.1"/> for TE path
	selection, event-dependent TE methods do not require ALB flooding.
	Rather, event-dependent TE methods typically search out capacity by
	learning models, as in the success-to-the-top (STT) method <xref target="RFC6601" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6601"/>. ALB flooding can be resource
	intensive, since it requires link bandwidth to carry routing protocol
	link-state advertisements and processor capacity to process those
	advertisements; in addition, the overhead of the ALB advertisements and
	their processing can limit the size of the area and AS.  Modeling
	results suggest that event-dependent TE methods could lead to a
	reduction in ALB flooding overhead without loss of network throughput
	performance <xref target="I-D.ietf-tewg-qos-routing" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TE-QoS-ROUTING"/>.</t>

            <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1.1.1-1">The IETF developed the Integrated Services (Intserv) model that
            requires resources, such as bandwidth and buffers, to be reserved
            a priori for a given traffic flow to ensure that the QoS requested
            by the traffic flow is satisfied.  The Intserv model includes
            additional components beyond those used in the best-effort model
            such as packet classifiers, packet schedulers, and admission
            control.  A packet classifier is used to identify flows that are
            to receive a certain level of service.  A packet scheduler handles
            the scheduling of service to different packet flows to ensure that
            QoS commitments are met.  Admission control is used to determine
            whether a router has the necessary resources to accept a new
            flow.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1.1.1-2">The main issue with the Intserv model has been scalability
            <xref target="RFC2998" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2998"/>, especially in large
            public IP networks that may potentially have millions of active
            traffic flows in transit concurrently.  Pre-Congestion
            Notification (PCN) <xref target="RFC5559" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5559"/>
            solves the scaling problems of Intserv by using measurement-based
            admission control (and flow termination to handle failures)
            between edge nodes.  Nodes between the edges of the internetwork
            have no per-flow operations, and the edge nodes can use the
            Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) per-flow or
            per-aggregate.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1.1.1-3">A notable feature of the Intserv model is that it requires
            explicit signaling of QoS requirements from end systems to routers
            <xref target="RFC2753" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2753"/>.  RSVP performs this

            <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1.1.2-1">The goal of Differentiated Services (Diffserv) within the IETF
            was to devise scalable mechanisms for categorization of traffic
            into behavior aggregates, which ultimately allows each behavior
            aggregate to be treated differently, especially when there is a
            shortage of resources, such as link bandwidth and buffer space
            <xref target="RFC2475" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2475"/>.  One of the primary
            motivations for Diffserv was to devise alternative mechanisms for
            service differentiation in the Internet that mitigate the
            scalability issues encountered with the Intserv model.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1.1.2-2">Diffserv uses the Differentiated Services field in the IP
            header (the DS field) consisting of six bits in what was formerly
            known as the Type of Service (TOS) octet.  The DS field is used to
            indicate the forwarding treatment that a packet should receive at
            a transit node <xref target="RFC2474" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2474"/>.
            Diffserv includes the concept of Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) groups.
            Using the PHBs, several classes of services can be defined using
            different classification, policing, shaping, and scheduling
            rules.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1.1.2-3">For an end user of network services to utilize Diffserv
            provided by its Internet Service Provider (ISP), it may
            be necessary for the user to have an SLA with the ISP.  An SLA may
            explicitly or implicitly specify a Traffic Conditioning Agreement
            (TCA) that defines classifier rules as well as metering, marking,
            discarding, and shaping rules.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1.1.2-4">Packets are classified and possibly policed and shaped at the
            ingress to a Diffserv network.  When a packet traverses the
            boundary between different Diffserv domains, the DS field of the
            packet may be re-marked according to existing agreements between
            the domains.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1.1.2-5">Diffserv allows only a finite number of service
            classes to be specified by the DS field.  The main advantage of
            the Diffserv approach relative to the Intserv model is
            scalability.  Resources are allocated on a per-class basis, and the
            amount of state information is proportional to the number of
            classes rather than to the number of application flows.</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1.1.2-6">Once the network has been planned and the packets have been
            marked at the network edge, the Diffserv model deals with traffic
            management issues on a per-hop basis.  The Diffserv control model
            consists of a collection of micro-TE control mechanisms.  Other TE
            capabilities, such as capacity management (including routing
            control), are also required in order to deliver acceptable service
            quality in Diffserv networks.  The concept of "Per-Domain
            Behaviors" has been introduced to better capture the notion of
            Diffserv across a complete domain <xref target="RFC3086" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3086"/>.</t>

            <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1.1.3-2">An SR Policy is identified through the tuple &lt;headend,

	    associates the SR Policy with an intent (e.g., low latency).</t>
            <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1.1.3-3">The headend node is notified of SR Policies and associated SR

            SR source-routed path), and the headend uses the endpoint and
            color parameters to classify packets to match the SR Policy and so
            determine along which path to forward them.  If an SR Policy is
            associated with a set of SR paths, each is associated with a
            weight for weighted load balancing.  Furthermore, multiple SR

            RSVP was originally developed as a signaling protocol within the

            packets and the local routing information maintained by the LSRs.
            An MPLS label stack entry is then prepended to each packet

            Before a packet leaves an MPLS domain, its MPLS label may be

          with continued changes that do not settle down.  Stability is a very
          important consideration in TE systems that respond to changes in the

       Generally, it is very difficult to provide good service quality in a

	  across paths of different costs.  Note that link metrics are
	  assigned following a range of operator-selected policies that might
	  reflect preference for the use of some links over others; therefore,
	  "shortest" might not be purely a measure of distance.  Using

              these two nodes may be under-utilized.</li>
              <li pn="section-6.2-3.1.2.2">The shortest paths from different sources can overlap at

              <li pn="section-6.2-3.1.2.3">Problems can also occur because traffic demand changes over
              time, but network topology and routing configuration cannot be
              changed as rapidly.  This causes the network topology and
              routing configuration to become sub-optimal over time, which may

          because it may also carry traffic from other sources.  This

        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-6.2-5">
          <li pn="section-6.2-5.1">Constraint-based routing computes routes to fulfill requirements
          subject to constraints.  This can be useful in public IP backbones
          with complex topologies.  Constraints may include bandwidth, hop
          count, delay, and administrative policy instruments, such as resource
          class attributes <xref target="RFC2702" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2702"/> <xref target="RFC2386" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2386"/>.  This makes it possible to
          select routes that satisfy a given set of requirements.  Routes
          computed by constraint-based routing are not necessarily the
          shortest paths.  Constraint-based routing works best with
          path-oriented technologies that support explicit routing, such as
          MPLS.</li>
          <li pn="section-6.2-5.2">Constraint-based routing can also be used as a way to distribute
          traffic onto the infrastructure, including for best-effort traffic.
          For example, congestion problems caused by uneven traffic
          distribution may be avoided or reduced by knowing the reservable
          bandwidth attributes of the network links and by specifying the
          bandwidth requirements for path selection.</li>
          <li pn="section-6.2-5.3">A number of enhancements to the link-state IGPs allow them to
          distribute additional state information required for
          constraint-based routing.  The extensions to OSPF are described in
          <xref target="RFC3630" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3630"/>, and the extensions to
          IS-IS are described in <xref target="RFC5305" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5305"/>.
          Some of the additional topology state information includes link
          attributes, such as reservable bandwidth and link resource class
          attribute (an administratively specified property of the link).  The
          resource class attribute concept is defined in <xref target="RFC2702" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2702"/>.  The additional topology state
          information is carried in new TLVs and sub-TLVs in IS-IS <xref target="RFC5305" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5305"/> or in the Opaque LSA in OSPF

          <li pn="section-6.2-5.4">An enhanced link-state IGP may flood information more frequently
          than a normal IGP.  This is because even without changes in
          topology, changes in reservable bandwidth or link affinity can
          trigger the enhanced IGP to initiate flooding.  A trade-off between
          the timeliness of the information flooded and the flooding frequency
          is typically implemented using a threshold based on the percentage
          change of the advertised resources to avoid excessive consumption of
          link bandwidth and computational resources and to avoid instability
          in the TED.</li>
          <li pn="section-6.2-5.5">In a TE system, it is also desirable for the routing subsystem
          to make the load-splitting ratio among multiple paths (with equal
          cost or different cost) configurable.  This capability gives network
          administrators more flexibility in the control of traffic
          distribution across the network.  It can be very useful for
          avoiding/relieving congestion in certain situations.  Examples can
          be found in <xref target="XIAO" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="XIAO"/> and <xref target="I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-unequal-lb" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="EVPN-UNEQUAL-LB"/>.</li>
          <li pn="section-6.2-5.6">The routing system should also have the capability to control
          the routes of subsets of traffic without affecting the routes of
          other traffic if sufficient resources exist for this purpose.  This
          capability allows a more refined control over the distribution of
          traffic across the network.  For example, the ability to move
          traffic away from its original path to another path (without
          affecting other traffic paths) allows the traffic to be moved from
          resource-poor network segments to resource-rich segments.
          Path-oriented technologies, such as MPLS-TE, inherently support this
          capability as discussed in <xref target="AWD2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="AWD2"/>.</li>
          <li pn="section-6.2-5.7">Additionally, the routing subsystem should be able to select
          different paths for different classes of traffic (or for different
          traffic behavior aggregates) if the network supports multiple
          classes of service (different behavior aggregates).</li>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-1">Traffic mapping is the assignment of traffic workload onto
        (pre-established) paths to meet certain requirements.  Thus, while
        constraint-based routing deals with path selection, traffic mapping
        deals with the assignment of traffic to established paths that may
        have been generated by constraint-based routing or by some other
        means.  Traffic mapping can be performed by time-dependent or
        state-dependent mechanisms, as described in <xref target="TIME" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.1"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-2">Two important aspects of the traffic mapping function are the
        ability to establish multiple paths between an originating node and a
        destination node and the capability to distribute the traffic across
        those paths according to configured policies.  A precondition for this
        scheme is the existence of flexible mechanisms to partition traffic
        and then assign the traffic partitions onto the parallel paths
        (described as "parallel traffic trunks" in <xref target="RFC2702" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2702"/>).  When traffic is assigned to multiple parallel
        paths, it is recommended that special care should be taken to ensure
        proper ordering of packets belonging to the same application (or
        traffic flow) at the destination node of the parallel paths.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.3-3">Mechanisms that perform the traffic mapping functions should aim to
        map the traffic onto the network infrastructure to minimize
        congestion.  If the total traffic load cannot be accommodated, or if
        the routing and mapping functions cannot react fast enough to changing
        traffic conditions, then a traffic mapping system may use short
        timescale congestion control mechanisms (such as queue management,
        scheduling, etc.) to mitigate congestion.  Thus, mechanisms that
        perform the traffic mapping functions complement existing congestion
        control mechanisms.  In an operational network, traffic should be
        mapped onto the infrastructure such that intra-class and inter-class
        resource contention are minimized (see <xref target="BG" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 2"/>).</t>

        feedback (e.g., MPLS Adaptive Traffic Engineering (MATE) <xref target="MATE" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="MATE"/> and

        Additional capabilities may be needed to help in the analysis of the
        statistics.  The actions of these mechanisms should not adversely
        affect the accuracy and integrity of the statistics collected.  The

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.4-2">Traffic statistics may be classified according to long-term or
        short-term timescales.  Long-term traffic statistics are very useful

        periodically record network workload (such as hourly, daily, and
        weekly variations in traffic profiles) as well as traffic trends.
        Aspects of the traffic statistics may also describe class of service
        characteristics for a network supporting multiple classes of service.
        Analysis of the long-term traffic statistics may yield other
        information such as busy-hour characteristics, traffic growth
        patterns, persistent congestion problems, hotspots, and imbalances in
        link utilization caused by routing anomalies.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.4-3">A mechanism for constructing traffic matrices for both long-term
        and short-term traffic statistics should be in place.  In
        multi-service IP networks, the traffic matrices may be constructed for
        different service classes.  Each element of a traffic matrix
        represents a statistic about the traffic flow between a pair of
        abstract nodes.  An abstract node may represent a router, a collection
        of routers, or a site in a VPN.</t>

        indicators include excessive packet delay, packet loss, and high
        resource utilization.  Examples of mechanisms for distributing this

          resources.  This planning may be centralized or distributed and
          must be aware of the planned traffic volumes and available
          resources.  However, this approach is only of value if the traffic
          that is presented conforms to the planned traffic volumes.</li>
          <li pn="section-6.5-2.2">Traffic flows may be policed at the edges of a network.  This is
          a simple way to ensure that the actual traffic volumes are
          consistent with the planned volumes.  Some form of measurement (see
          <xref target="MSRREC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.4"/>) is used to determine the
          rate of arrival of traffic, and excess traffic could be discarded.
          Alternatively, excess traffic could be forwarded as best-effort

        maintain service continuity in the presence of faults.  This can be
        accomplished by promptly recovering from network impairments and
        maintaining the required QoS for existing services after recovery.
        Survivability is an issue of great concern within the Internet
        community due to the demand to carry mission-critical traffic,
        real-time traffic, and other high-priority traffic over the Internet.
        Survivability can be addressed at the device level by developing
        network elements that are more reliable and at the network
        level by incorporating redundancy into the architecture, design, and
        operation of networks.  It is recommended that a philosophy of
        robustness and survivability should be adopted in the architecture,
        design, and operation of TE used to control IP networks (especially
        public IP networks).  Because different contexts may demand different
        levels of survivability, the mechanisms developed to support network
        survivability should be flexible so that they can be tailored to
        different needs.  
A number of tools and techniques have been developed

        can be configured at each router.  PHBs are delivered using
        buffer-management and packet-scheduling mechanisms and require that

        performance of some service classes by enforcing relationships between
        the traffic workload contributed by each service class and the amount
        of network resources allocated or provisioned for that service class.
        Such relationships between demand and resource allocation can be
        enforced using a combination of, for example:

        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.8-6">It may also be desirable to limit the performance impact of
        high-priority traffic on relatively low-priority traffic.  This can be
        achieved, for example, by controlling the percentage of high-priority
        traffic that is routed through a given link.  Another way to
        accomplish this is to increase link capacities appropriately so that
        lower-priority traffic can still enjoy adequate service quality.  When
        the ratio of traffic workload contributed by different service classes
        varies significantly from router to router, it may not be enough to
        rely on conventional IGP routing protocols or on TE mechanisms that
        are not sensitive to different service classes.  Instead, it may be
        desirable to perform TE, especially routing control and mapping
        functions, on a per-service-class basis.  One way to accomplish this
        in a domain that supports both MPLS and Diffserv is to define
        class-specific LSPs and to map traffic from each class onto one or
        more LSPs that correspond to that service class.  An LSP corresponding
        to a given service class can then be routed and protected/restored in
        a class-dependent manner, according to specific policies.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-6.8-7">Performing TE on a per-class basis may require per-class parameters
        to be distributed.  It is common to have some classes share some
        aggregate constraints (e.g., maximum bandwidth requirement) without
        enforcing the constraint on each individual class.  These classes can
        be grouped into class types, and per-class-type parameters can be
        distributed to improve scalability.  This also allows better bandwidth
        sharing between classes in the same class type.  A class type is a set
        of classes that satisfy the following two conditions:</t>

      between BGP and other protocols, and influence the selection of best
      paths by manipulating the attributes (either standardized or local to
      the implementation) associated with the BGP decision process.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-5">When considering inter-domain TE with BGP, note that the outbound
      traffic exit point is controllable, whereas the interconnection point
      where inbound traffic is received typically is not.  Therefore, it is up
      to each individual network to implement TE strategies that deal with the
      efficient delivery of outbound traffic from its customers to its peering
      points.  The vast majority of TE policy is based on a "closest exit"
      strategy, which offloads inter-domain traffic at the nearest outbound
      peering point towards the destination AS.  Most methods of manipulating
      the point at which inbound traffic enters are either ineffective or

      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-6">Inter-domain TE with BGP is generally effective, but it is usually
      applied in a trial-and-error fashion because a TE system usually only
      has a view of the available network resources within one domain (an AS
      in this case).  A systematic approach for inter-domain TE requires
      cooperation between the domains.  Further, what may be considered a good
      solution in one domain may not necessarily be a good solution in
      another.  Moreover, it is generally considered inadvisable for one
      domain to permit a control process from another domain to influence the
      routing and management of traffic in its network.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-7">MPLS-TE tunnels (LSPs) can add a degree of flexibility in the
      selection of exit points for inter-domain routing by applying the
      concept of relative and absolute metrics.  If BGP attributes are defined
      such that the BGP decision process depends on IGP metrics to select exit
      points for inter-domain traffic, then some inter-domain traffic destined
      to a given peer network can be made to prefer a specific exit point by
      establishing a TE tunnel between the router making the selection and the
      peering point via a TE tunnel and assigning the TE tunnel a metric
      that is smaller than the IGP cost to all other peering points.  RSVP-TE

      exhaustive.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-2">Service providers apply many of the TE mechanisms described in this
      document to optimize the performance of their IP networks, although
      others choose to not use any of them.  These techniques include capacity
      planning, including adding ECMP options, for long timescales; routing
      control using IGP metrics and MPLS, as well as path planning and path
      control using MPLS and SR for medium timescales; and
      traffic management mechanisms for short timescales.</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-8-3">
        <li pn="section-8-3.1">Capacity planning is an important component of how a service
        provider plans an effective IP network.  These plans may take the
        following aspects into account: location of any new links or nodes,
        WECMP algorithms, existing and predicted traffic patterns, costs, link
        capacity, topology, routing design, and survivability.</li>
        <li pn="section-8-3.2">Performance optimization of operational networks is usually an
        ongoing process in which traffic statistics, performance parameters,
        and fault indicators are continually collected from the network.  This
        empirical data is analyzed and used to trigger TE mechanisms.  Tools
        that perform what-if analysis can also be used to assist the TE
        process by reviewing scenarios before a new set of configurations are
        implemented in the operational network.</li>
        <li pn="section-8-3.3">Real-time intra-domain TE using the IGP is done by increasing the
        OSPF or IS-IS metric of a congested link until enough traffic has been
        diverted away from that link.  This approach has some limitations as
        discussed in <xref target="ROUTEREC" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6.2"/>.  Intra-domain
        TE approaches <xref target="RR94" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RR94"/> <xref target="FT00" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="FT00"/> <xref target="FT01" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="FT01"/> <xref target="WANG" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="WANG"/> take
        traffic matrix, network topology, and network performance objectives
        as input and produce link metrics and load-sharing ratios.  These
        processes open the possibility for intra-domain TE with IGP to be done
        in a more systematic way.</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-4">Administrators of MPLS-TE networks specify and configure link
      attributes and resource constraints such as maximum reservable bandwidth
      and resource class attributes for the links in the domain.  A link-state
      IGP that supports TE extensions (IS-IS-TE or OSPF-TE) is used to
      propagate information about network topology and link attributes to all
      routers in the domain.  Network administrators specify the LSPs that are
      to originate at each router.  For each LSP, the network administrator
      specifies the destination node and the attributes of the LSP that
      indicate the requirements that are to be satisfied during the path
      selection process.  The attributes may include an explicit path for the
      LSP to follow, or the originating router may use a local
      constraint-based routing process to compute the path of the LSP.
      RSVP-TE is used as a signaling protocol to instantiate the LSPs.  By
      assigning proper bandwidth values to links and LSPs, congestion caused
      by uneven traffic distribution can be avoided or mitigated.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-5">The bandwidth attributes of an LSP relate to the bandwidth
      requirements of traffic that flows through the LSP.  The traffic
      attribute of an LSP can be modified to accommodate persistent shifts in
      demand (traffic growth or reduction).  If network congestion occurs due
      to unexpected events, existing LSPs can be rerouted to alleviate the
      situation, or the network administrator can configure new LSPs to divert
      some traffic to alternative paths.  The reservable bandwidth of the
      congested links can also be reduced to force some LSPs to be rerouted to
      other paths.  A traffic matrix in an MPLS domain can also be estimated
      by monitoring the traffic on LSPs.  Such traffic statistics can be used
      for a variety of purposes including network planning and network
      optimization.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-6">Network management and planning systems have evolved and assumed a
      lot of the responsibility for determining traffic paths in TE networks.
      This allows a network-wide view of resources and facilitates
      coordination of the use of resources for all traffic flows in the
      network.  Initial solutions using a PCE to perform path computation on
      behalf of network routers have given way to an approach that follows the
      SDN architecture.  A stateful PCE is able to track all of the LSPs in
      the network and can redistribute them to make better use of the
      available resources.  Such a PCE can form part of a network orchestrator
      that uses PCEP or some other configuration and management interface to
      instruct the signaling protocol or directly program the routers.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-7">SR leverages a centralized TE controller and either an
      MPLS or IPv6 forwarding plane but does not need to use a signaling
      protocol or management plane protocol to reserve resources in the
      routers.  All resource reservation is logical within the controller and
      is not distributed to the routers.  Packets are steered through the
      network using SR, and this may have configuration and
      operational scaling benefits.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-8">As mentioned in <xref target="INTER" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7"/>, there is
      usually no direct control over the distribution of inbound traffic to a
      domain.  Therefore, the main goal of inter-domain TE is to optimize the
      distribution of outbound traffic between multiple inter-domain links.
      When operating a geographically widespread network (such as for a
      multi-national or global network provider), maintaining the ability to
      operate the network in a regional fashion where desired, while
      continuing to take advantage of the benefits of a globally
      interconnected network, also becomes an important objective.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-9">Inter-domain TE with BGP begins with the placement of multiple
      peering interconnection points that are in close proximity to traffic
      sources/destinations and offer lowest-cost paths across the network
      between the peering points and the sources/destinations.  Some
      location-decision problems that arise in association with inter-domain
      routing are discussed in <xref target="AWD5" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="AWD5"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-10">Once the locations of the peering interconnects have been determined
      and implemented, the network operator decides how best to handle the
      routes advertised by the peer, as well as how to propagate the peer's
      routes within their network.  One way to engineer outbound traffic flows
      in a network with many peering interconnects is to create a hierarchy of
      peers.  Generally, the shortest AS paths will be chosen to forward
      traffic, but BGP metrics can be used to prefer some peers and so favor
      particular paths.  Preferred peers are those peers attached through
      peering interconnects with the most available capacity.  Changes may be
      needed, for example, to deal with a "problem peer" who is difficult to
      work with on upgrades or is charging high prices for connectivity to
      their network.  In that case, the peer may be given a reduced
      preference.  This type of change can affect a large amount of traffic
      and is only used after other methods have failed to provide the desired
      results.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-11">When there are multiple exit points toward a given peer, and only one
      of them is congested, it is not necessary to shift traffic away from the
      peer entirely, but only from the one congested connection. This can be
      achieved by using passive IGP metrics, AS_PATH filtering, or prefix
      filtering.</t>

      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-9-3">
        <li pn="section-9-3.1">TE may use tunnels that can slightly help protect traffic from

        <li pn="section-9-3.2">TE puts traffic onto predictable paths within the network that may
        make it easier to find and attack.</li>
        <li pn="section-9-3.3">TE often increases the complexity of operation and management of
        the network, which may lead to errors that compromise security.</li>

        able to provide additional security functions.</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-4">The consequences of attacks on the control and management protocols
      used to operate TE networks can be significant:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-9-5">
        <li pn="section-9-5.1">Traffic can be hijacked

        <li pn="section-9-5.2">Traffic can be steered onto paths that
      deliver quality that is below the desired quality.</li>
        <li pn="section-9-5.3">Networks can be

      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-6">Thus, it is
      important to use adequate protection mechanisms, such as authentication,
      on all protocols used to deliver TE.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-7">Certain aspects of a network may be deduced from the details of the
      TE paths that are used.  For example, the link connectivity of the
      network and the quality and load on individual links may be inferred
      from knowing the paths of traffic and the requirements they place on the
      network (for example, by seeing the control messages or through
      path-trace techniques).  Such knowledge can be used to launch targeted
      attacks (for example, taking down critical links) or can reveal
      commercially sensitive information (for example, whether a network is
      close to capacity).  Therefore, network operators may choose techniques
      that mask or hide information from within the network.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-9-8">External control interfaces that are introduced to provide additional
      control and management of TE systems (see <xref target="TEapproach" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5.1.2"/>) provide flexibility to management and to customers,
      but they do so at the risk of exposing the internals of a network to
      potentially malicious actors.  The protocols used at these interfaces
      must be secured to protect against snooping and modification, and use of
      the interfaces must be authenticated.</t>

            <t indent="0">   This document describes the framework for NRP-based Enhanced Virtual
   Private Networks (VPNs) to support the needs of applications with
   specific traffic performance requirements (e.g., low latency, bounded
   jitter).  NRP-based Enhanced VPNs leverage the VPN and Traffic
   Engineering (TE) technologies and adds characteristics that specific
   services require beyond those provided by conventional VPNs.
   Typically, an NRP-based enhanced VPN will be used to underpin network
   slicing, but could also be of use in its own right providing enhanced
   connectivity services between customer sites.  This document also
   provides an overview of relevant technologies in different network
   layers, and identifies some areas for potential new work.

To deliver reliable service, MPLS requires a set of procedures to provide protection of the traffic carried on different paths. This requires that the label switching routers (LSRs) support fault detection, fault notification, and fault recovery mechanisms, and that MPLS signaling support the configuration of recovery. With these objectives in mind, this document specifies a framework for MPLS based recovery. Restart issues are not included in this framework.

            <t indent="0">This document defines RSVP-TE extensions to establish backup label-switched path (LSP) tunnels for local repair of LSP tunnels. These mechanisms enable the re-direction of traffic onto backup LSP tunnels in 10s of milliseconds, in the event of a failure.</t>
            <t indent="0">Two methods are defined here. The one-to-one backup method creates detour LSPs for each protected LSP at each potential point of local repair. The facility backup method creates a bypass tunnel to protect a potential failure point; by taking advantage of MPLS label stacking, this bypass tunnel can protect a set of LSPs that have similar backup constraints. Both methods can be used to protect links and nodes during network failure. The described behavior and extensions to RSVP allow nodes to implement either method or both and to interoperate in a mixed network. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

            <t indent="0">The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) allows Path Computation Clients (PCCs) to request path computations from Path Computation Elements (PCEs), and lets the PCEs return responses. When computing or reoptimizing the routes of a set of Traffic Engineering Label Switched Paths (TE LSPs) through a network, it may be advantageous to perform bulk path computations in order to avoid blocking problems and to achieve more optimal network-wide solutions. Such bulk optimization is termed Global Concurrent Optimization (GCO). A GCO is able to simultaneously consider the entire topology of the network and the complete set of existing TE LSPs, and their respective constraints, and look to optimize or reoptimize the entire network to satisfy all constraints for all TE LSPs. A GCO may also be applied to some subset of the TE LSPs in a network. The GCO application is primarily a Network Management System (NMS) solution.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">This document presents a generic connection admission control (GCAC) reference model and algorithm for IP-/MPLS-based networks. Service provider (SP) IP/MPLS networks need an MPLS GCAC mechanism, as one motivational example, to reject Voice over IP (VoIP) calls when additional calls would adversely affect calls already in progress. Without MPLS GCAC, connections on congested links will suffer degraded quality. The MPLS GCAC algorithm can be optionally implemented in vendor equipment and deployed by service providers. MPLS GCAC interoperates between vendor equipment and across multiple service provider domains. The MPLS GCAC algorithm uses available standard mechanisms for MPLS-based networks, such as RSVP, Diffserv-aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE), Path Computation Element (PCE), Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS), Diffserv, and OSPF. The MPLS GCAC algorithm does not include aspects of CAC that might be considered vendor proprietary implementations, such as detailed path selection mechanisms. MPLS GCAC functions are implemented in a distributed manner to deliver the objective Quality of Service (QoS) for specified QoS constraints. The objective is that the source is able to compute a source route with high likelihood that via-elements along the selected path will in fact admit the request. In some cases (e.g., multiple Autonomous Systems (ASes)), this objective cannot always be met, but this document summarizes methods that partially meet this objective. MPLS GCAC is applicable to any service or flow that must meet an objective QoS (delay, jitter, packet loss rate) for a specified quantity of traffic. This document defines an Experimental Protocol for the Internet community.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">Computing optimum routes for Label Switched Paths (LSPs) across multiple domains in MPLS Traffic Engineering (MPLS-TE) and GMPLS networks presents a problem because no single point of path computation is aware of all of the links and resources in each domain. A solution may be achieved using the Path Computation Element (PCE) architecture.</t>
            <t indent="0">Where the sequence of domains is known a priori, various techniques can be employed to derive an optimum path. If the domains are simply connected, or if the preferred points of interconnection are also known, the Per-Domain Path Computation technique can be used. Where there are multiple connections between domains and there is no preference for the choice of points of interconnection, the Backward-Recursive PCE-based Computation (BRPC) procedure can be used to derive an optimal path.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document examines techniques to establish the optimum path when the sequence of domains is not known in advance. The document shows how the PCE architecture can be extended to allow the optimum sequence of domains to be selected, and the optimum end-to-end path to be derived through the use of a hierarchical relationship between domains. This document is not an Internet Standards Track specification; it is published for informational purposes.</t>

            <t indent="0">Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has been one of the major buzz words of the networking industry for the past couple of years. And yet, no clear definition of what SDN actually covers has been broadly admitted so far. This document aims to clarify the SDN landscape by providing a perspective on requirements, issues, and other considerations about SDN, as seen from within a service provider environment.</t>
            <t indent="0">It is not meant to endlessly discuss what SDN truly means but rather to suggest a functional taxonomy of the techniques that can be used under an SDN umbrella and to elaborate on the various pending issues the combined activation of such techniques inevitably raises. As such, a definition of SDN is only mentioned for the sake of clarification.</t>

            <t indent="0">Applications using the Internet already have access to some topology information of Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks. For example, views to Internet routing tables at Looking Glass servers are available and can be practically downloaded to many network application clients. What is missing is knowledge of the underlying network topologies from the point of view of ISPs. In other words, what an ISP prefers in terms of traffic optimization -- and a way to distribute it.</t>
            <t indent="0">The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) services defined in this document provide network information (e.g., basic network location structure and preferences of network paths) with the goal of modifying network resource consumption patterns while maintaining or improving application performance. The basic information of ALTO is based on abstract maps of a network. These maps provide a simplified view, yet enough information about a network for applications to effectively utilize them. Additional services are built on top of the maps.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document describes a protocol implementing the ALTO services. Although the ALTO services would primarily be provided by ISPs, other entities, such as content service providers, could also provide ALTO services. Applications that could use the ALTO services are those that have a choice to which end points to connect. Examples of such applications are peer-to-peer (P2P) and content delivery networks.</t>

            <t indent="0">The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a specialized web transfer protocol for constrained devices and constrained networks. It is anticipated that constrained devices will often naturally operate in groups (e.g., in a building automation scenario, all lights in a given room may need to be switched on/off as a group). This specification defines how CoAP should be used in a group communication context. An approach for using CoAP on top of IP multicast is detailed based on existing CoAP functionality as well as new features introduced in this specification. Also, various use cases and corresponding protocol flows are provided to illustrate important concepts. Finally, guidance is provided for deployment in various network topologies.</t>

            <t indent="0">Software-Defined Networking (SDN) refers to a new approach for network programmability, that is, the capacity to initialize, control, change, and manage network behavior dynamically via open interfaces. SDN emphasizes the role of software in running networks through the introduction of an abstraction for the data forwarding plane and, by doing so, separates it from the control plane. This separation allows faster innovation cycles at both planes as experience has already shown. However, there is increasing confusion as to what exactly SDN is, what the layer structure is in an SDN architecture, and how layers interface with each other. This document, a product of the IRTF Software-Defined Networking Research Group (SDNRG), addresses these questions and provides a concise reference for the SDN research community based on relevant peer-reviewed literature, the RFC series, and relevant documents by other standards organizations.</t>

            <t indent="0">Services such as content distribution, distributed databases, or inter-data center connectivity place a set of new requirements on the operation of networks. They need on-demand and application-specific reservation of network connectivity, reliability, and resources (such as bandwidth) in a variety of network applications (such as point-to-point connectivity, network virtualization, or mobile back-haul) and in a range of network technologies from packet (IP/MPLS) down to optical. An environment that operates to meet these types of requirements is said to have Application-Based Network Operations (ABNO). ABNO brings together many existing technologies and may be seen as the use of a toolbox of existing components enhanced with a few new elements.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document describes an architecture and framework for ABNO, showing how these components fit together. It provides a cookbook of existing technologies to satisfy the architecture and meet the needs of the applications.</t>

Such a capability eliminates the need for periodic polling of YANG datastores by applications and fills a functional gap in existing YANG transports (i.e., Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) and RESTCONF). Such a service can be summarized as a "pub/sub" service for YANG datastore updates. Beyond a set of basic requirements for the service, various refinements are addressed. These refinements include: periodicity of object updates, filtering out of objects underneath a requested a subtree, and delivery QoS guarantees.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">In Traffic-Engineered (TE) systems, it is sometimes desirable to establish an end-to-end TE path with a set of constraints (such as bandwidth) across one or more networks from a source to a destination. TE information is the data relating to nodes and TE links that is used in the process of selecting a TE path. TE information is usually only available within a network. We call such a zone of visibility of TE information a domain. An example of a domain may be an IGP area or an Autonomous System.</t>
            <t indent="0">In order to determine the potential to establish a TE path through a series of connected networks, it is necessary to have available a certain amount of TE information about each network. This need not be the full set of TE information available within each network but does need to express the potential of providing TE connectivity. This subset of TE information is called TE reachability information.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document sets out the problem statement for the exchange of TE information between interconnected TE networks in support of end-to-end TE path establishment and describes the best current practice architecture to meet this problem statement. For reasons that are explained in this document, this work is limited to simple TE constraints and information that determine TE reachability.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">Bufferbloat is a phenomenon in which excess buffers in the network cause high latency and latency variation. As more and more interactive applications (e.g., voice over IP, real-time video streaming, and financial transactions) run in the Internet, high latency and latency variation degrade application performance. There is a pressing need to design intelligent queue management schemes that can control latency and latency variation, and hence provide desirable quality of service to users.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document presents a lightweight active queue management design called "PIE" (Proportional Integral controller Enhanced) that can effectively control the average queuing latency to a target value. Simulation results, theoretical analysis, and Linux testbed results have shown that PIE can ensure low latency and achieve high link utilization under various congestion situations. The design does not require per-packet timestamps, so it incurs very little overhead and is simple enough to implement in both hardware and software.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">Cable modems based on Data-Over-Cable Service Interface Specifications (DOCSIS) provide broadband Internet access to over one hundred million users worldwide. In some cases, the cable modem connection is the bottleneck (lowest speed) link between the customer and the Internet. As a result, the impact of buffering and bufferbloat in the cable modem can have a significant effect on user experience. The CableLabs DOCSIS 3.1 specification introduces requirements for cable modems to support an Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithm that is intended to alleviate the impact that buffering has on latency-sensitive traffic, while preserving bulk throughput performance. In addition, the CableLabs DOCSIS 3.0 specifications have also been amended to contain similar requirements. This document describes the requirements on AQM that apply to DOCSIS equipment, including a description of the "DOCSIS-PIE" algorithm that is required on DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems.</t>

            <t indent="0">This document specifies a new architecture for the forwarding of multicast data packets. It provides optimal forwarding of multicast packets through a "multicast domain". However, it does not require a protocol for explicitly building multicast distribution trees, nor does it require intermediate nodes to maintain any per-flow state. This architecture is known as "Bit Index Explicit Replication" (BIER). When a multicast data packet enters the domain, the ingress router determines the set of egress routers to which the packet needs to be sent. The ingress router then encapsulates the packet in a BIER header. The BIER header contains a bit string in which each bit represents exactly one egress router in the domain; to forward the packet to a given set of egress routers, the bits corresponding to those routers are set in the BIER header. The procedures for forwarding a packet based on its BIER header are specified in this document. Elimination of the per-flow state and the explicit tree-building protocols results in a considerable simplification.</t>

            <t indent="0">The Path Computation Element (PCE) is a core component of Software- Defined Networking (SDN) systems. It can compute optimal paths for traffic across a network and can also update the paths to reflect changes in the network or traffic demands.</t>
            <t indent="0">PCE was developed to derive paths for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs), which are supplied to the head end of the LSP using the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP).</t>
            <t indent="0">SDN has a broader applicability than signaled MPLS traffic-engineered (TE) networks, and the PCE may be used to determine paths in a range of use cases including static LSPs, segment routing, Service Function Chaining (SFC), and most forms of a routed or switched network. It is, therefore, reasonable to consider PCEP as a control protocol for use in these environments to allow the PCE to be fully enabled as a central controller.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document briefly introduces the architecture for PCE as a central controller, examines the motivations and applicability for PCEP as a control protocol in this environment, and introduces the implications for the protocol.

An ordered list of segments is encoded as an ordered list of IPv6 addresses in the routing header. The active segment is indicated by the Destination Address (DA) of the packet. The next active segment is indicated by a pointer in the new routing header.</t>

            <t indent="0">This document provides the overall architecture for Deterministic Networking (DetNet), which provides a capability to carry specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications with extremely low data loss rates and bounded latency within a network domain. Techniques used include 1) reserving data-plane resources for individual (or aggregated) DetNet flows in some or all of the intermediate nodes along the path of the flow, 2) providing explicit routes for DetNet flows that do not immediately change with the network topology, and 3) distributing data from DetNet flow packets over time and/or space to ensure delivery of each packet's data in spite of the loss of a path. DetNet operates at the IP layer and delivers service over lower-layer technologies such as MPLS and Time- Sensitive Networking (TSN) as defined by IEEE 802.1.</t>

            <t indent="0">Segment Routing (SR) enables any head-end node to select any path without relying on a hop-by-hop signaling technique (e.g., LDP or RSVP-TE). It depends only on "segments" that are advertised by link-state Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs). An SR path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), an explicit configuration, or a Path Computation Element (PCE). This document specifies extensions to the Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) that allow a stateful PCE to compute and initiate Traffic-Engineering (TE) paths, as well as a Path Computation Client (PCC) to request a path subject to certain constraints and optimization criteria in SR networks.</t>

            <t indent="0">TCP/IP communication is currently restricted to a single path per connection, yet multiple paths often exist between peers. The simultaneous use of these multiple paths for a TCP/IP session would improve resource usage within the network and thus improve user experience through higher throughput and improved resilience to network failure.</t>
            <t indent="0">Multipath TCP provides the ability to simultaneously use multiple paths between peers. This document presents a set of extensions to traditional TCP to support multipath operation. The protocol offers the same type of service to applications as TCP (i.e., a reliable bytestream), and it provides the components necessary to establish and use multiple TCP flows across potentially disjoint paths.</t>

BIER-TE can leverage BIER forwarding engines with little changes. Co-existence of BIER and BIER-TE forwarding in the same domain is possible -- for example, by using separate BIER "subdomains" (SDs). Except for the optional routed adjacencies, BIER-TE does not require a BIER routing underlay and can therefore operate without depending on a routing protocol such as the "Interior Gateway Protocol" (IGP).</t>

            <t indent="0">Intent and Intent-Based Networking are taking the industry by storm. At the same time, terms related to Intent-Based Networking are often used loosely and inconsistently, in many cases overlapping and confused with other concepts such as "policy." This document clarifies the concept of "intent" and provides an overview of the functionality that is associated with it. The goal is to contribute towards a common and shared understanding of terms, concepts, and functionality that can be used as the foundation to guide further definition of associated research and engineering problems and their solutions.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">This specification defines a framework for coupling the Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithms in two queues intended for flows with different responses to congestion. This provides a way for the Internet to transition from the scaling problems of standard TCP-Reno-friendly ('Classic') congestion controls to the family of 'Scalable' congestion controls. These are designed for consistently very low queuing latency, very low congestion loss, and scaling of per-flow throughput by using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in a modified way. Until the Coupled Dual Queue (DualQ), these Scalable L4S congestion controls could only be deployed where a clean-slate environment could be arranged, such as in private data centres.</t>
            <t indent="0">This specification first explains how a Coupled DualQ works. It then gives the normative requirements that are necessary for it to work well. All this is independent of which two AQMs are used, but pseudocode examples of specific AQMs are given in appendices.</t>

            <t indent="0">IGP protocols historically compute the best paths over the network based on the IGP metric assigned to the links. Many network deployments use RSVP-TE or Segment Routing - Traffic Engineering (SR-TE) to steer traffic over a path that is computed using different metrics or constraints than the shortest IGP path. This document specifies a solution that allows IGPs themselves to compute constraint-based paths over the network. This document also specifies a way of using Segment Routing (SR) Prefix-SIDs and SRv6 locators to steer packets along the constraint-based paths.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">The cost metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
Optimization (ALTO), and different applications may use different
types of cost metrics. Since the ALTO base protocol (RFC 7285)
defines only a single cost metric (namely, the generic "routingcost"
metric), if an application wants to issue a cost map or an endpoint
cost request in order to identify a resource provider that offers
better performance metrics (e.g., lower delay or loss rate), the base
protocol does not define the cost metric to be used.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document addresses this issue by extending the specification to
provide a variety of network performance metrics, including network
delay, delay variation (a.k.a. jitter), packet loss rate, hop count,
and bandwidth.</t>
            <t indent="0">There are multiple sources (e.g., estimations based on measurements
or a Service Level Agreement) available for deriving a performance
metric. This document introduces an additional "cost-context" field
to the ALTO "cost-type" field to convey the source of a performance
metric.</t>

            <t indent="0">In many environments, a component external to a network is called upon to perform computations based on the network topology and the current state of the connections within the network, including Traffic Engineering (TE) information. This is information typically distributed by IGP routing protocols within the network.</t>

The mechanism described is subject to policy control.</t>

            <t indent="0">   This document presents Topology Independent Loop-free Alternate Fast
   Re-route (TI-LFA), aimed at providing protection of node and
   adjacency segments within the Segment Routing (SR) framework.  This
   Fast Re-route (FRR) behavior builds on proven IP-FRR concepts being
   LFAs, remote LFAs (RLFA), and remote LFAs with directed forwarding
   (DLFA).  It extends these concepts to provide guaranteed coverage in
   any two connected networks using a link-state IGP.  A key aspect of
   TI-LFA is the FRR path selection approach establishing protection
   over the expected post-convergence paths from the point of local
   repair, reducing the operational need to control the tie-breaks among
   various FRR options.
