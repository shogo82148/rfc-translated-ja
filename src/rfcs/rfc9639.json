FLAC is designed to reduce the amount of\r\ncomputer storage space needed to store digital audio signals. It does\r\nthis losslessly, i.e., it does so without losing information. FLAC is\r\nfree in the sense that its specification is open and its reference\r\nimplementation is open source. Compared to other lossless audio\r\ncoding formats, FLAC is a format with low complexity and can be\r\nencoded and decoded with little computing resources. Decoding of FLAC\r\nhas been implemented independently for many different platforms, and\r\nboth encoding and decoding can be implemented without needing\r\nfloating-point arithmetic.","pub_date":"December 2024","keywords":["free","lossless","audio","codec","encoder","decoder","compression","compressor","archival","archive","archiving","backup","music"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9639","errata_url":null}
