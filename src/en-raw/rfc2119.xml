    <abstract pn="section-abstract">
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-2">   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL
   NOT&quot;, &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;,  &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-3">Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
level of the document in which they are used.</t>

truly optional.  One vendor may choose to include the item because a
particular marketplace requires it or because the vendor feels that
it enhances the product while another vendor may omit the same item.
An implementation which does not include a particular option <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be
prepared to interoperate with another implementation which does
include the option, though perhaps with reduced functionality. In the
same vein an implementation which does include a particular option
<bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be prepared to interoperate with another implementation which
does not include the option (except, of course, for the feature the
option provides.)</t>

and sparingly.  In particular, they <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> only be used where it is
actually required for interoperation or to limit behavior which has
potential for causing harm (e.g., limiting retransmisssions)  For
example, they must not be used to try to impose a particular method
on implementors where the method is not required for
interoperability.</t>

implications.  The effects on security of not implementing a <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> or
<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>, or doing something the specification says <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> or <bcp14>SHOULD
NOT</bcp14> be done may be very subtle. Document authors should take the time
to elaborate the security implications of not following
recommendations or requirements as most implementors will not have
had the benefit of the experience and discussion that produced the
specification.</t>
