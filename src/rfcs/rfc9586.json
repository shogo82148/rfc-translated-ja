Message numbers are not returned in responses and cannot be\r\nused in requests once this extension is enabled.  This helps both\r\nclients and servers to reduce resource usage required to maintain a\r\nmap between message numbers and UIDs. \r\n\r\nThis document defines an experimental IMAP extension.","pub_date":"May 2024","keywords":["IMAP","UIDONLY","IMAP4rev1","IMAP4rev2"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9586","errata_url":null}
