      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">This document describes network slicing in the context of networks
      built from IETF technologies.  It defines the term "IETF Network Slice"
      to describe this type of network slice and establishes the general
      principles of network slicing in the IETF context.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-2">The document discusses the general framework for requesting and
      operating IETF Network Slices, the characteristics of an IETF Network
      Slice, the necessary system components and interfaces, and the mapping
      of abstract requests to more specific technologies.  The document also
      discusses related considerations with monitoring and security.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">A number of use cases would benefit from a network service that
      supplements connectivity, such as that offered by a VPN service, with an
      assurance of meeting a set of specific network performance objectives.
      This connectivity and resource commitment is referred to as a "network
      slice" and is expressed in terms of connectivity constructs (see <xref target="objectives" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/>) and service objectives (see
      <xref target="NS-Char" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5"/>).  Since the term "network
      slice" is rather generic and has wider or different interpretations
      within other standards bodies, the qualifying term "IETF" is used in
      this document to limit the scope of the network slices described to
      network technologies defined and standardized by the IETF.  This
      document defines the concept of "IETF Network Slices" that provide
      connectivity coupled with a set of specific commitments of network
      resources between a number of endpoints (known as Service Demarcation
      Points (SDPs); see Sections <xref target="Terms" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="3.2"/> and <xref target="sdp" format="counter" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="5.2"/>) over a shared underlay network that
      utilizes IETF technology.  The term "IETF Network Slice Service" is also
      introduced to describe the service requested by and provided to the
      service provider's customer.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">It is intended that the terms "IETF Network Slice" and "IETF Network
      Slice Service" be used only in this document.  Other documents that need
      to indicate the type of network slice or network slice service described
      in this document can use the terms "RFC 9543 Network Slice" and "RFC
      9543 Network Slice Service".</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">This document also provides a general framework for requesting and
      operating IETF Network Slices.  The framework is intended as a structure

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-7">IETF Network Slices are created and managed within the scope of one
      or more network technologies (e.g., IP, MPLS, and optical) that use an
      IETF-specified data plane and/or management/control plane.  They are
      intended to enable a diverse set of applications with different
      requirements to coexist over a shared underlay network.  A request for
      an IETF Network Slice Service is agnostic to the technology in the
      underlay network so as to allow customers to describe their network
      connectivity objectives in a common format, independent of the underlay
      technologies used.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-8">Many preexisting approaches to service delivery and traffic
      engineering already use mechanisms that can be considered as network
      slicing.  For example, Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) have served the
      industry well as a means of providing different groups of users with
      logically isolated access to a common network.  The common or base
      network that is used to support the VPNs is often referred to as an
      "underlay network", and the VPN is often called an "overlay network".
      An overlay network may, in turn, serve as an underlay network to support
      another overlay network.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-9">Note that it is conceivable that extensions to IETF technologies are
      needed in order to fully support all the capabilities that can be
      implemented with network slices.  Evaluation of existing
      technologies, proposed extensions to existing protocols and
      interfaces, and creation of new protocols or interfaces are outside
      the scope of this document.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-1">The concept of network slicing has gained traction, driven largely by
      needs surfacing from 5G (see <xref target="NGMN-NS-Concept" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="NGMN-NS-Concept"/>,
      <xref target="TS23.501" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TS23.501"/>, and <xref target="TS28.530" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TS28.530"/>).  In <xref target="TS23.501" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TS23.501"/>, a Network Slice is defined as a "logical network
      that provides specific network capabilities and network
      characteristics", and a Network Slice Instance is defined as a "set of
      Network Function instances and the required resources (e.g. compute,
      storage and networking resources) which form a deployed Network Slice".
      According to <xref target="TS28.530" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TS28.530"/>, an end-to-end (E2E)
      network slice consists of three major types of network segments: Radio
      Access Network (RAN), Transport Network (TN), and Core Network (CN).  An
      IETF Network Slice provides the required connectivity between different
      entities in RAN and CN segments of an end-to-end network slice, with a
      specific performance commitment (for example, serving as a TN slice).
      For each end-to-end network slice, the topology and performance
      requirement on a customer's use of an IETF Network Slice can be
      very different, which requires the underlay network to have the
      capability of supporting multiple different IETF Network Slices.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-2">While network slices are commonly discussed in the context of 5G, it
      is important to note that IETF Network Slices are a narrower concept
      with a broader usage profile and focus primarily on particular
      network connectivity aspects.  Other systems, including 5G deployments,
      may use IETF Network Slices as a component to create entire systems and
      concatenated constructs that match their needs, including end-to-end
      connectivity.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-3">An IETF Network Slice could span multiple technologies and multiple
      administrative domains.  Depending on the IETF Network Slice Service
      customer's requirements, an IETF Network Slice could be isolated
      from other, often concurrent, IETF Network Slices in terms of data,
      control, and management planes.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-4">The customer expresses requirements for a particular IETF Network
      Slice Service by specifying what is required rather than how the
      requirement is to be fulfilled.  That is, the IETF Network Slice Service
      customer's view of an IETF Network Slice Service is an abstract
      one.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-5">Thus, there is a need to create logical network structures with
      required characteristics.  The customer of such a logical network can
      require a level of isolation and performance that previously might not
      have been satisfied by overlay VPNs.  Additionally, the IETF Network
      Slice Service customer might ask for some level of control to, e.g.,
      customize the service paths in a network slice.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-6">This document specifies definitions and a framework for the provision
      of an IETF Network Slice Service.  <xref target="realize" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 7"/> briefly indicates some candidate technologies for

        that differentiate one type of user traffic from another within a
        network.  An IETF Network Slice is a logical partition of a network
        that uses IETF technology.  An IETF Network Slice assumes that an
        underlay network is capable of changing the configurations of the
        network devices on demand, through in-band signaling, or via
        controllers.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-2">An IETF Network Slice enables connectivity between a set of SDPs
        with specific Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level
        Expectations (SLEs) (see <xref target="NS-Char" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5"/>)
        over a common underlay network.  The SLOs and SLEs characterize the
        performance of the underlay network between a sending SDP and a set of
        receiving SDPs.  Thus, an IETF Network Slice delivers a service to a
        customer by meeting connectivity resource requirements and associated
        network capabilities such as bandwidth, latency, jitter, and network
        functions with other resource behaviors such as compute and storage

        sequentially so that various different networks can each be sliced and
        the network slices placed into a sequence to provide an
        end-to-end service.  This form of sequential combination is utilized

        customer by realizing an IETF Network Slice in the underlay network.
        The IETF Network Slice Service is agnostic to the technology of the
        underlay network, and its realization may be selected based upon
        multiple considerations, including its service requirements and the
        capabilities of the underlay network.  This allows an IETF Network
        Slice Service customer to describe their network connectivity and
        relevant objectives in a common format, independent of the underlay
        technologies used.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.2-2">The IETF Network Slice Service is specified in terms of a set of
        SDPs, a set of one or more connectivity constructs between subsets of

        construct.  A communication type (Point-to-Point (P2P),
        Point-to-Multipoint (P2MP), or Any-to-Any (A2A)) is specified for each
        connectivity construct. That is, in a given IETF Network Slice Service:</t>

        or may be external through service provision contracts.  As noted in

              connectivity constructs because the provider's network must
              determine to which receiving SDPs to deliver each packet.  This
              construct may be used to support P2P traffic between any pair of

              or using "ingress replication" or some other means is out of
              scope of the specification of the service.  A service provider

              influences how and where traffic is replicated in the network.
              With a P2MP or A2A connectivity construct, it is the

              receivers.  A customer may wish to achieve an MP2MP service
              using a hub-and-spoke architecture where they control the hub;
              that is, the hub may be an SDP or an ancillary CE (see <xref target="ancillary" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.2.3"/>), and the service may be

          Network Slice Service needs to be supplemented with additional
          senders or receivers within the network that are not customer sites.
          An additional sender could be, for example, an IPTV or DNS server
          either within the provider's network or attached to it, while
          an extra receiver could be, for example, a node reachable via the

          set of ancillary CEs that supplement the other SDPs in one or more
          connectivity constructs or that are linked by their own
          connectivity constructs.  Note that an ancillary CE can either have
          a resolvable address (e.g., an IP address or MAC address), or it may
          be a placeholder (e.g., a named IPTV or DNS service or server) that

          example is a node that provides a service function.  Another example
          is a node that acts as a hub.  There will be times when the customer
          wishes to explicitly select one of these.  Alternatively, an
          ancillary CE may be a service function at an unknown point in the
          provider's network.  In this case, the function may be a

                Slicing the resources on the AC may require the use of traffic
                tagging (such as through Ethernet VLAN tags) or may require

                virtual port (e.g., VLAN tag) identifies the IETF Network Slice
                and maps to an IETF Network Slice SDP.</li>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-5">The network itself (at the bottom of <xref target="archfig" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 4"/>) comprises an underlay network.  This could be a
        physical network but may be a virtual network.  The underlay network
        is provisioned through network controllers <xref target="RFC8309" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8309"/> that may, themselves, utilize device
        controllers.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-6">The underlay network may optionally be filtered or customized by
        the network operator to produce a number of network topologies that we
        call "Filtered Topologies".  Customization is just a way of selecting
        specific resources (e.g., nodes and links) from the underlay network
        according to their capabilities and connectivity in the underlay
        network.  Filtering and customization are configuration options or
        operator policies that preselect links and nodes with certain
        performance characteristics to enable easier construction of Network
        Resource Partitions (NRPs; see below) that can reliably support
        specific IETF Network Slice SLAs, for example, preselection of links
        with certain security characteristics, preselection of links with
        specific geographic properties, or mapping to colored topologies.  The
        resulting topologies can be used as candidates to host IETF Network
        Slices and provide a useful way for the network operator to know in
        advance that all of the resources they are using to plan an IETF
        Network Slice would be able to meet specific SLOs and SLEs.  The
        creation of a Filtered Topology could be an offline planning activity
        or could be performed dynamically as new demands arise.  The use of
        Filtered Topologies is entirely optional in the architecture, and IETF
        Network Slices could be hosted directly on the underlay network.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-7">Recall that an IETF Network Slice is a service requested by and/or
        provided for the customer.  The IETF Network Slice Service is
        expressed in terms of one or more connectivity constructs.  An
        implementation or operator is free to limit the number of connectivity
        constructs in an IETF Network Slice to exactly one.  Each connectivity
        construct is associated within the IETF Network Slice Service request
        with a set of SLOs and SLEs.  The set of SLOs and SLEs does not need
        to be the same for every connectivity construct in the IETF Network
        Slice, but an implementation or operator is free to require that all
        connectivity constructs in an IETF Network Slice have the same set of
        SLOs and SLEs.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-8">An NRP is a subset of the buffer/queuing/scheduling resources and
        associated policies on each of a connected set of links in the
        underlay network (for example, as achieved in <xref target="I-D.ietf-spring-resource-aware-segments" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RESOURCE-AWARE-SEGMENTS"/>).
        The connected set of links could be the entire set of links with all
        of their buffer/queuing/scheduling resources and behaviors in the
        underlay network, and in this case, there would be just one NRP
        supported in the underlay network.  The amount and granularity of
        resources allocated in an NRP is flexible and depends on the
        operator's policy.  Some NRP realizations may build NRPs with
        dedicated topologies, while other realizations may use a shared
        topology for multiple NRPs.  Realizations of an NRP may be built on a
        range of existing or new technologies, and this document does not
        constrain solution technologies.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-9">One or more connectivity constructs from one or more IETF Network
        Slices are mapped to an NRP.  A single connectivity construct is
        mapped to only one NRP (that is, the relationship is many to one).
        Thus, all traffic flows in a connectivity construct assigned to an NRP
        are assigned to that NRP.  Further, all PEs connected by a
        connectivity construct must be present in the NRP to which that
        connectivity construct is assigned.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-10">An NRP may be chosen to support a specific connectivity construct
        because of its ability to support a specific set of SLOs and SLEs,
        its ability to support particular connectivity constructs, or any
        administrative or operational reason.  An implementation or operator
        is free to map each connectivity construct to a separate NRP, although
        there may be scaling implications depending on the solution
        implemented.  Thus, the connectivity constructs from one slice may be
        mapped to one or more NRPs.  By implication from the above, an
        implementation or operator is free to map all the connectivity
        constructs in a slice to a single NRP and to not share that NRP with
        connectivity constructs from another slice.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-11">An NRP may use work-conserving schedulers, non-work-conserving
        schedulers, or both (see <xref target="RFC3290" sectionFormat="of" section="2" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3290#section-2" derivedContent="RFC3290"/>) according to the function that it needs to deliver.
        The choice of how network resources are allocated and managed for an
        NRP, and whether a work-conserving scheduling approach or a
        non-work-conserving scheduling approach is adopted, is technology
        specific: an implementation or operator is free to choose the set of
        techniques for NRP realization.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-12">The process of determining the NRP may be made easier if the
        underlay network topology is first filtered into a Filtered Topology
        in order to be aware of the subset of network resources that are
        suitable for specific NRPs.  In this case, each Filtered Topology is
        treated as an underlay network on which NRPs can be constructed.  The
        stage of generating Filtered Topologies is optional within this
        framework.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-13">The steps described here can be applied in a variety of orders according to implementation and deployment
           preferences.  Furthermore, the steps may be iterative so that the components are continually refined and
           modified as network conditions change and as service requests are received or relinquished, and even the
           underlay network could be extended if necessary to meet the customers' demands.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.3-2">In many ways, the function of ACTN is similar to IETF network
        slicing.  Customer requests for connectivity-based overlay services
        are mapped to dedicated or shared resources in the underlay network in
        a way that meets customer guarantees for SLOs and

            <t indent="0">   Network abstraction is a technique that can be applied to a network
   domain to obtain a view of potential connectivity across the network
   by utilizing a set of policies to select network resources.

   Network slicing is an approach to network operations that builds on
   the concept of network abstraction to provide programmability,
   flexibility, and modularity.  It may use techniques such as Software
   Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to
   create multiple logical or virtual networks, each tailored for a set
   of services that share the same set of requirements.

   Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks (ACTN) is
   described in RFC 8453.  It defines an SDN-based architecture that
   relies on the concept of network and service abstraction to detach
   network and service control from the underlying data plane.

   This document outlines the applicability of ACTN to network slicing
   in a Traffic Engineered (TE) network that utilizes IETF technologies.
   It also identifies the features of network slicing not currently
   within the scope of ACTN, and indicates where ACTN might be extended.

            <t indent="0">   This document describes the mechanism to associate network resources
   to Segment Routing Identifiers (SIDs).  Such SIDs are referred to as
   resource-aware SIDs in this document.  The resource-aware SIDs retain
   their original forwarding semantics, but with the additional
   semantics to identify the set of network resources available for the
   packet processing and forwarding action.  The resource-aware SIDs can
   therefore be used to build SR paths or virtual networks with a set of
   reserved network resources.  The proposed mechanism is applicable to
   both segment routing with MPLS data plane (SR-MPLS) and segment
   routing with IPv6 data plane (SRv6).

The complexity raised by the control of such data planes is similar to that seen in classical IP/MPLS networks. By extending MPLS to support multiple switching technologies, GMPLS provides a comprehensive framework for the control of a multi-layered network of either a single switching technology or multiple switching technologies.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">In Traffic-Engineered (TE) systems, it is sometimes desirable to establish an end-to-end TE path with a set of constraints (such as bandwidth) across one or more networks from a source to a destination. TE information is the data relating to nodes and TE links that is used in the process of selecting a TE path. TE information is usually only available within a network. We call such a zone of visibility of TE information a domain. An example of a domain may be an IGP area or an Autonomous System.</t>
            <t indent="0">In order to determine the potential to establish a TE path through a series of connected networks, it is necessary to have available a certain amount of TE information about each network. This need not be the full set of TE information available within each network but does need to express the potential of providing TE connectivity. This subset of TE information is called TE reachability information.</t>
            <t indent="0">This document sets out the problem statement for the exchange of TE information between interconnected TE networks in support of end-to-end TE path establishment and describes the best current practice architecture to meet this problem statement. For reasons that are explained in this document, this work is limited to simple TE constraints and information that determine TE reachability.</t>

They also have a range of management and provisioning protocols to configure and activate network resources. These mechanisms represent key technologies for enabling flexible and dynamic networking.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.2-3">A customer may want to utilize a service where traffic is delivered
        from CE1 to CE3, including a service function sited within the
        customer's network at CE2.  To achieve this, the customer may
        request an IETF Network Slice Service comprising two P2P connectivity
        constructs: CE1-CE2 and CE2-CE3 (represented with "*" in <xref target="ancfig" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 6"/>).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.2-4">Alternatively, the service function for the same CE1 to CE3 flow
        may be hosted at a node within the network operator's
        infrastructure.  This is an ancillary CE in the IETF Network Slice
        Service that the customer requests.  This service contains two P2P
        connectivity constructs: CE1-ACE1 and ACE1-CE3 (represented with "o" in
        <xref target="ancfig" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 6"/>).  How the customer knows of
        the existence of the ancillary CE and the service functions it
        offers is a  matter for agreement between the customer and the network
        operator.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.2-5">Finally, it may be that the customer knows that the network
        operator is able to provide the service function but does not know the
        location of the ancillary CE at which the service function is hosted.
        Indeed, it may be that the service function is hosted at a number of
        ancillary CEs (ACE2, ACE3, and ACE4 in <xref target="ancfig" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 6"/>); the customer may know the identities of the
        ancillary CEs but be unwilling or unable to choose one, or the
        customer may not know about the ancillary CEs.  In this case, the IETF
        Network Slice Service request contains two P2P connectivity constructs:
        CE1-ServiceFunction and ServiceFunction-CE3 (represented with "x" in
        <xref target="ancfig" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 6"/>).  It is left as a choice
        for the network operator as to which ancillary CE to use and how to
        realize the connectivity constructs.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.3-1">Hub and spoke is a popular way to realize A2A connectivity
        in support of multiple P2P traffic flows (where the hub performs
        routing) or P2MP flows (where the hub is responsible for
        replication).  In many cases, it is the network operator's choice
        whether to use hub and spoke to realize a mesh of P2P connectivity
        constructs or P2MP connectivity constructs; this is entirely their
        business as the customer is not aware of how the connectivity
        constructs are supported within the network.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.3-2">However, it may be the case that the customer wants to control the
        behavior and location of the hub.  In this case, the hub appears as an
        ancillary CE as shown in <xref target="hns1fig" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 7"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.3-3">For the P2P mesh case, the customer does not specify a mesh of P2P
        connectivity constructs (such as CE1-CE2, CE1-CE3, CE2-CE3, and the
        equivalent reverse direction connectivity) but connects each CE to the
        hub with P2P connectivity constructs (as CE1-Hub, CE2-Hub, CE3-Hub,
        and the equivalent reverse direction connectivity).  This scales
        better in terms of provisioning compared to a full mesh but requires
        that the hub is capable of routing traffic between connectivity
        constructs.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.3-4">For the P2MP case, the customer does not specify a single P2MP
        connectivity construct (in this case, CE3-{CE1+CE2}) but requests
        three P2P connectivity constructs (as CE3-Hub, Hub-CE1, and Hub-CE2).
        It is the hub's responsibility to replicate the traffic from CE3
        and send it to both CE1 and CE2.</t>

        technologies and under separate administrative control, the networks
        are sliced individually, and coordination is necessary to deliver the
        desired connectivity.  The Network-to-Network Interfaces (NNIs) are
        present as SDPs for the IETF Network Slices in each network, so that
        each network is individually sliced.  In the example in <xref target="peerdlvrfig" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 12"/>, this is illustrated as
        network 1 (N/w1) being sliced between SDP1 and SDPX, N/w2 being sliced
        between SDPY and SDPU, etc.  The coordination activity involves
        binding the SDPs, and hence the connectivity constructs, to achieve
        end-to-end connectivity with the required SLOs and SLEs.  In this way,
        simple and complex end-to-end connectivity can be achieved with a
