The aim is for explicit congestion signals to\r\npropagate consistently from lower-layer protocols into IP. Then, the\r\nIP internetwork layer can act as a portability layer to carry\r\ncongestion notification from non-IP-aware congested nodes up to the\r\ntransport layer (L4). Specifications that follow these guidelines,\r\nwhether produced by the IETF or other standards bodies,  should\r\nassure interworking among IP-layer and lower-layer congestion\r\nnotification mechanisms. This document is included in BCP 89 and\r\nupdates the single paragraph of advice to subnetwork designers about\r\nExplicit Congestion Notification (ECN) in Section 13 of RFC 3819 by\r\nreplacing it with a reference to this document.","pub_date":"August 2024","keywords":["Congestion Control and Management","Congestion Notification","Information Security","Tunnelling","Encapsulation","Decapsulation","Protocol","ECN","Layering"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3819"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":["BCP0089"],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9599","errata_url":null}
