This\r\ndocument provides a record, for the benefit of the IETF community, of\r\nthe considerations arrived at by the NVO3 Working Group starting from\r\nthe output of the NVO3 encapsulation Design Team. These\r\nconsiderations may be helpful with future deliberations by working\r\ngroups over the choice of encapsulation formats.\r\n\r\nThere are implications of having different encapsulations in real\r\nenvironments consisting of both software and hardware implementations\r\nand within and spanning multiple data centers.  For example,\r\nOperations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) functions such as\r\npath MTU discovery become challenging with multiple encapsulations\r\nalong the data path.\r\n\r\nBased on these considerations, the NVO3 Working Group determined that\r\nGeneric Network Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve) with a few\r\nmodifications is the common encapsulation. This document provides\r\nmore details, particularly in Section 7.","pub_date":"September 2024","keywords":["Encapsulation","NVE","Geneve","GUE","VXLAN-GPE"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9638","errata_url":null}
