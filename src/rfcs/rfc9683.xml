      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">There are many aspects to consider in fielding a trusted computing device,
from operating systems to applications.  Mechanisms to prove that
a device installed at a customer's site is authentic (i.e., not counterfeit) and has
been configured with authorized software, all as part of a trusted supply chain, are just a few of the many aspects that need to be considered concurrently to have confidence that a device is truly trustworthy.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">A generic architecture for remote attestation has been defined in <xref target="RFC9334" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9334"/>.  Additionally, use cases for remotely attesting networking devices are discussed within <xref target="I-D.richardson-rats-usecases" sectionFormat="of" section="5" format="default" derivedLink="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-richardson-rats-usecases-08#section-5" derivedContent="RATS-USECASES"/>.  However, these documents do not provide sufficient guidance for network equipment vendors and operators to design, build, and deploy interoperable devices.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">The intent of this document is to provide such guidance. It does this by outlining the Remote Integrity Verification (RIV) problem and then by identifying the necessary elements to get the complete, scalable attestation procedure working with commercial networking products such as routers, switches, and firewalls.   An underlying assumption is the availability within the device of a cryptoprocessor that is compatible with the Trusted Platform Module specifications <xref target="TPM-1.2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TPM-1.2"/> <xref target="TPM-2.0" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TPM-2.0"/> to enable the trustworthy, remote assessment of the device's software and hardware.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-2">Additionally, this document defines the following term:</t>
        <dl indent="3" newline="false" spacing="normal" pn="section-1.2-3">
          <dt pn="section-1.2-3.1">Attestation:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-1.2-3.2">The process of generating, conveying, and appraising
claims, backed by evidence, about device trustworthiness characteristics, including supply chain trust,
identity, device provenance, software configuration, device
composition, compliance to test suites, functional and assurance evaluations, etc.</dd>
        </dl>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-4">The goal of attestation is simply to assure an administrator or auditor that the device's configuration and software
were authentic and unmodified when the device started.
The determination of software authenticity is not prescribed in this document, but it's typically taken to mean
a software image generated by an authority trusted by the administrator, such as the device manufacturer.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-5">Within the context of the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), the scope of attestation is typically narrowed to describe the process by
which an independent Verifier can obtain cryptographic proof as to the identity
of the device in question, evidence of the integrity of the device's software that was loaded upon
startup, and verification that the current configuration matches the 
intended configuration.  For network equipment, a Verifier capability can
be embedded in a Network Management Station, a posture collection server,
or other network analytics tool (such as a software asset management solution,
or a threat detection and mitigation tool, etc.). 
This document focuses on a specific subset of attestation tasks, defined here as Remote
Integrity Verification (RIV), and informally referred to as attestation.  RIV in this document takes a network-equipment-centric perspective
that includes a set of protocols and procedures for determining whether a
particular device was launched with authentic software, starting from Roots
of Trust.  While there are many ways to accomplish attestation, RIV sets
out a specific set of protocols and tools that work in environments commonly
found in network equipment.  RIV does not cover other device characteristics
that could be attested (e.g., geographic location or connectivity; 
see <xref target="I-D.richardson-rats-usecases" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RATS-USECASES"/>), although it does provide evidence of a secure infrastructure
to increase the level of trust in other device characteristics attested
by other means (e.g., by Entity Attestation Tokens <xref target="I-D.ietf-rats-eat" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RATS-EAT"/>).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.2-6">In line with definitions found in <xref target="RFC9334" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9334"/>, this document uses the term Endorser to refer to the 
role that signs identity and attestation certificates used by the Attester, while Reference Values are signed 
by a Reference Value Provider.  Typically, the manufacturer of a network device would be accepted as 
both the Endorser and Reference Value Provider, although the choice is ultimately up to the Verifier Owner.</t>

assurance that their network comprises authentic equipment and has loaded software

assessment, plus configuration management.</t>

          <li pn="section-1.4-3.1">Provable Device Identity - This specification requires that an Attester (i.e., the attesting device) includes
a cryptographic identifier unique to each device.  Effectively, this means that the device's TPM
must be provisioned with this during the manufacturing cycle.</li>
          <li pn="section-1.4-3.2">Software Inventory - Key goals are to identify the software release(s) installed
on the Attester and to provide evidence that the software stored within hasn't
been altered without authorization.</li>
          <li pn="section-1.4-3.3">Verifiability - Verification of the device's software and configuration shows
that the software that the administrator authorized for use was actually launched.</li>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.5-1">Attestation requires two interlocking mechanisms between the Attester network device and the Verifier:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-1.5-2">
          <li pn="section-1.5-2.1">Device Identity is the mechanism that provides trusted identity, which can reassure network
managers that the specific devices they ordered from authorized manufacturers for
attachment to their network are those that were installed and that they continue to
be present in their network. As part of the mechanism for Device Identity,
cryptographic proof of the manufacturer's identity is also provided.</li>
          <li pn="section-1.5-2.2">Software Measurement is the mechanism that reports the state of mutable software components
on the device and that can assure administrators that they have known, authentic
software configured to run in their network.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.5-3">By using these two interlocking mechanisms, RIV, which is a component in a chain of procedures, can assure a network operator that the equipment in
their network can be reliably identified and that authentic software of
a known version is installed on each device.  Equipment in the network includes
devices that make up the network itself, such as routers, switches, and firewalls.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.5-4">Software used to boot a device can be identified by a chain
of measurements, anchored at the start by a Root of Trust for Measurement (RTM) (see <xref target="root-of-trust" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix A.2"/>). An attestation function embedded in each stage, verified by the previous stage, measures the next stage
and records the result in tamper-resistant storage. 
A measurement signifies the identity, integrity, and version of each
software component registered with an Attester's TPM <xref target="TPM-1.2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TPM-1.2"/> <xref target="TPM-2.0" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TPM-2.0"/> so that a
subsequent verification stage can determine if the software
installed is authentic, up-to-date, and free of tampering.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.5-5">RIV includes several major processes, which are split between the Attester and Verifier:</t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1" indent="adaptive" start="1" pn="section-1.5-6"><li pn="section-1.5-6.1" derivedCounter="1.">Generation of Evidence is the process whereby an Attester generates cryptographic
proof (Evidence) of claims about device properties. In particular, the
device identity and its software configuration are both of critical importance.</li>
          <li pn="section-1.5-6.2" derivedCounter="2.">Device Identification refers to the mechanism assuring the
Relying Party (ultimately, a network administrator) of the identities of devices, and the identities of their manufacturers, that make up their network.</li>
          <li pn="section-1.5-6.3" derivedCounter="3.">Conveyance of Evidence
 reliably transports the collected Evidence from the Attester to a Verifier to allow a management station to perform
 a meaningful appraisal in Step 4. The transport
 is typically carried out via a management network.
 Although not required for reliable attestation, an encrypted channel may be used to
 provide integrity, authenticity, or confidentiality once attestation is complete.
 It should be noted that critical attestation evidence from the TPM is signed by a key known only to TPM, and is not
 dependent on encryption carried out as part of a reliable transport.</li>
          <li pn="section-1.5-6.4" derivedCounter="4.">Finally, appraisal of evidence occurs.  This is the process of verifying the Evidence received by
  a Verifier from the Attester and using an Appraisal Policy to develop an
  Attestation Result, which is used to inform decision-making.  In practice, this means comparing
  the Attester's measurements reported as Evidence with the device configuration expected
  by the Verifier.  Subsequently, the Appraisal Policy for Evidence might
  match Evidence found against Reference Values (aka Golden Measurements), which represent 
  the intended configured state of the connected device.</li>
        </ol>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-1.5-7">All implementations supporting this RIV specification require the support of the following three technologies:</t>

coupled with careful supply-chain management by the manufacturer.  The
Initial DevID (IDevID) certificate contains a statement by the manufacturer that establishes
the identity of the device as it left the factory.  Some applications with
a more complex post-manufacture supply chain (e.g., value added resellers),
or with different privacy concerns, may want to use alternative mechanisms for platform
authentication (for example, TCG Platform Certificates <xref target="PLATFORM-CERTS" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="PLATFORM-CERTS"/> or 
post-manufacture installation of Local DevID (LDevID)).</li>
          <li pn="section-1.5-8.2" derivedCounter="2.">Platform attestation provides evidence of configuration of software elements
present in the device.  This form of attestation can be implemented
with TPM Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) and  Quote and Log mechanisms, which provide cryptographically authenticated evidence
to report what software was started on the device through the boot cycle.  Successful attestation requires an 
unbroken chain from a boot-time Root of Trust through all layers of software needed to bring the device to an 
operational state, in which each stage computes the hash of components of the next stage, then updates the attestation log and 
the TPM.  The TPM can then report the hashes of all the measured hashes as signed evidence called a 
Quote (see <xref target="using-tpm" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix A.1"/> for an overview of TPM operation or <xref target="TPM-1.2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TPM-1.2"/> and <xref target="TPM-2.0" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TPM-2.0"/> for many more details).</li>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1-1">RIV Attestation is a process that can be used to determine the identity of software running
on a specifically identified device.  The Remote Attestation steps of <xref target="RIV-desc" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 1.5"/> are split into two
phases as shown in <xref target="RIV-Attestation-Model" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/>:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-2.1-2">
          <li pn="section-2.1-2.1">During system startup, or Boot Phase, each distinct software object is "measured" by the Attester.
The object's identity, hash (i.e., cryptographic digest), and version information are recorded in a log.
Hashes are also extended into the TPM (see <xref target="using-tpm" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix A.1"/> for more on extending hashes) in a way that can be used to validate the log entries.  The measurement process generally
follows the layered chain-of-trust model used in Measured Boot, where each stage
of the system measures the next one, and extends its measurement into the TPM,
before launching it.  See <xref target="RFC9334" sectionFormat="of" section="3.2" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9334#section-3.2" derivedContent="RFC9334"/>, "Layered Attestation Environments", for an architectural definition
of this model.</li>
          <li pn="section-2.1-2.2">Once the device is running and has operational network connectivity, verification can take place.  A separate
 Verifier, running in its own trusted environment, will interrogate the network
device to retrieve the logs and a copy of the digests collected by hashing
each software object, signed by an attestation private key secured by, but never released by,
the TPM.  The YANG model described in <xref target="RFC9684" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9684"/> facilitates this operation.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1-3">The result is that the Verifier can verify the device's identity by checking
the subject <xref target="RFC5280" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5280"/> and signature of the certificate containing the TPM's attestation public key.
The Verifier can then verify the log's correctness by accumulating all the hashes in the log
and comparing that to the signed digests from the TPM.  From
there, the Verifier can validate the launched software by
comparing the digests in the log with Reference Values.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1-4">It should be noted that attestation and identity are inextricably linked;
signed Evidence that a particular version of software was loaded is of little
value without cryptographic proof of the identity of the Attester producing
the Evidence.</t>

among multiple 
UEFI BIOS vendors, it should be noted that embedded software vendors may have considerably more flexibility.  Verifiers 
typically need to know which log entries are consequential and which are not (possibly controlled by local policies), but 
the Verifier may not need to know what each log entry means or why it was assigned to a particular PCR.   Designers must
recognize that some PCRs may cover log entries that a particular Verifier considers critical and other log entries that
are not considered important, so differing PCR values may not on their own constitute a check for authenticity.  For example, in a UEFI system, some administrators may consider booting an image from a removable drive, something recorded in a PCR, to be a security violation, while others might consider that operation to be an authorized recovery procedure.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.2-5">Designers may allocate particular events to specific PCRs in order to achieve a particular objective with local 
attestation (e.g., allowing a procedure to execute, or releasing a particular decryption key, only if a given PCR is in a given state).  It may also be important 
to designers to consider whether streaming notification of PCR updates is required (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-rats-network-device-subscription" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RATS-NET-DEV-SUB"/>).  Specific 
log entries can only be validated if the Verifier receives every log entry affecting the relevant PCR, so (for example) 
a designer might want to separate rare, high-value events, such as configuration changes, from high-volume, routine 
measurements such as IMA logs <xref target="IMA" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IMA"/>.</t>

their networks, the software supplier should supply the Reference Values, in

are essentially single threaded and executed exactly once, in a known sequence,
before any results can be reported.  In this case, while the method for
computing the hash and extending relevant PCRs may be complicated, the net
result is that the software (more likely, firmware) vendor will have one
known good PCR value that "should" be present in the relevant PCRs after the box has
booted.  In this case, the signed reference measurement could simply list the
expected hashes for the given version.  However, a RIM that contains the
intermediate hashes can be useful in debugging cases where the expected final hash
is not the one reported.</li>
            <li pn="section-2.4.1-4.2" derivedCounter="2.">Measurements taken later in operation of the system, once an OS has started
(for example, Linux IMA <xref target="IMA" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IMA"/>), may be more complex, with unpredictable "final"
PCR values.  In this case, the Verifier must have enough information to reconstruct
the expected PCR values from logs and signed reference measurements from
a trusted authority.</li>
          </ol>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4.1-5">In both cases, the expected values can be expressed as signed SWID or CoSWID tags,
but the SWID structure in the second case is somewhat more complex, as reconstruction of the extended hash in a PCR may involve thousands of files and other objects.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.4.1-6">TCG has published an information model defining elements of RIMs
under the title "TCG Reference Integrity Manifest (RIM) Information Model" <xref target="RIM" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RIM"/>.  This information model outlines how SWID tags should be structured to allow attestation, and it defines "bundles" of SWID tags that may be needed to describe a complete software release.

In light of these requirements for protecting the privacy of users of the network, the network equipment
must identify itself, and its boot configuration and measured device state (for example, PCR values),
to the equipment's administrator so there's no uncertainty about the device's function and

signing key cannot be used to spoof an attestation quote.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-5">In each case, the private half of the key is known only to the TPM and cannot be
retrieved externally, even by a trusted party.  To ensure that's the case,
specification-compliant private/public key pairs are generated inside the TPM, where they are never
exposed and cannot be extracted (see <xref target="PLATFORM-DEVID-TPM-2.0" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="PLATFORM-DEVID-TPM-2.0"/>).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-6">Keeping keys safe is a critical enabler of trustworthiness, but it's just part of attestation security; knowing which keys are bound

devices (e.g., SZTP <xref target="RFC8572" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8572"/>), where keys that have predictable trust properties are
provisioned by the device vendor.</t>

DevID certificate plus the chain of intermediate certificates leading back to the manufacturer's root
certificate.  As is conventional in TLS or SSH connections, a random nonce must be signed by the device
in response to a challenge,
proving possession of its DevID private key.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-13">RIV uses the DevID to validate a TLS or SSH connection to the device as the attestation session begins.  Security of
this process derives from TLS or SSH security, with the DevID, which contains a device serial number, providing proof that the session terminates on
the intended device. See <xref target="RFC8446" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8446"/> <xref target="RFC4253" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4253"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-14">Evidence of software integrity is delivered in the form of a quote that is signed by the TPM
itself and accompanied by an IAK certificate containing the same identity information as the DevID.  Because the contents of the quote are signed inside the TPM, any external
modification (including reformatting to a different data format) after measurements have been taken will be detected
as tampering.  An unbroken chain of trust is essential for ensuring that blocks of code that are taking
measurements have been verified before execution (see <xref target="RIV-Attestation-Model" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/>).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-15">Requiring measurements of the operating software to be signed by a key known only to the TPM also
removes the need to trust the device's operating software (beyond the first measurement in the RTM; see below). 
If malicious software makes any changes to a quote
in the device itself, or in the path back to the Verifier, the signature on the quote will
be invalidated.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-16">A critical feature of the YANG model described in <xref target="RFC9684" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9684"/> is the ability to carry TPM data structures in their TCG-defined format, without requiring any changes to the structures as they were signed and delivered by the TPM.

An identity key must be available to sign any kind of nonce or hash offered by the Verifier,

Result, the quote generated inside the TPM must be signed by
a key, known as an AK, that's different from the DevID.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5-1">In addition to the trustworthy provisioning of keys, RIV depends on a number of other factors for trustworthy operation.</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-5.5-2">
          <li pn="section-5.5-2.1">Secure identity depends on mechanisms to prevent per-device secret keys from being compromised.  The TPM
provides this capability as a Root of Trust for Storage.</li>
          <li pn="section-5.5-2.2">Attestation depends on an unbroken chain of measurements, starting from the very first 
measurement.  See <xref target="using-tpm" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix A.1"/> for background on TPM practices.</li>
          <li pn="section-5.5-2.3">That first measurement is made by code called the RTM, typically done by trusted
firmware stored in boot flash.  Mechanisms for maintaining the trustworthiness of the RTM are out of
scope for RIV, but could include immutable firmware, signed updates, or a vendor-specific hardware
verification technique.    See <xref target="root-of-trust" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix A.2"/> for background on Roots of Trust.</li>
          <li pn="section-5.5-2.4">The device owner <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> provide some level of physical defense for the device.  If a TPM that has already been programmed
with an authentic DevID is stolen and is inserted into a counterfeit device, attestation of that counterfeit
device may become indistinguishable from an authentic device.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5-3">RIV also depends on reliable Reference Values, as expressed by the RIM <xref target="RIM" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RIM"/>.  The definition of
trust procedures for RIMs is out of scope for RIV, and the device owner is free to use any policy to validate
a set of reference measurements.  It should also be noted that, while RIV can provide a reliable indication that a known software package is in use by the device and that the package has not been tampered with, it is the device owner's responsibility to determine that it's the correct package for the application.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5-4">RIMs may be conveyed either out-of-band or in-band as part of the attestation
process (see <xref target="RIM-policy" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.1.3"/>).  However, for network devices, where software is usually shipped as a self-contained
package, RIMs signed by the manufacturer and delivered in-band may be more convenient for the device owner.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.5-5">The validity of RIV attestation results is also influenced by procedures used to create Reference Values:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-5.5-6">
          <li pn="section-5.5-6.1">While the RIM itself is signed, supply chains <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be carefully scrutinized to ensure that the values are 
not subject to unexpected manipulation prior to signing.  Insider attacks against code bases and build chains
are particularly hard to spot.</li>
          <li pn="section-5.5-6.2">Designers <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> guard against hash collision attacks.  RIMs often give hashes for large objects
of indeterminate size. If one of the measured objects can be replaced with an implant engineered to produce
the same hash, RIV will be unable to detect the substitution.  TPM 1.2 only uses SHA-1 hashes, which have been
shown to be susceptible to collision attack.  TPM 2.0 will produce quotes with SHA-256, which so far has resisted
such attacks.  Consequently, RIV implementations <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> use TPM 2.0.</li>

   TPM-based Challenge-Response based Remote Attestation (CHARRA) to
   allow for subscription to the Conceptual Message type Evidence.
   Additionally, this memo provides the methods and means to define
   additional Event Streams for other Conceptual Messages than Evidence
   as illustrated in the RATS Architecture, e.g., Attestation Results,
   Reference Values, or Endorsements.  The module defined requires at
   least one TPM 1.2, TPM 2.0, or equivalent hardware implementation
   providing the same protected capabilities as TPMs to be available in
   the Attester the YANG server is running on.

              <t indent="0">   This document defines the method and bindings used to convey Evidence
   via Time-based Uni-Directional Attestation (TUDA) in Remote
   ATtestation procedureS (RATS).  TUDA does not require a challenge-
   response handshake and thereby does not rely on the conveyance of a
   nonce to prove freshness of remote attestation Evidence.  TUDA
   enables the creation of Secure Audit Logs that can constitute
   believable Evidence about both current and past operational states of
   an Attester.  In TUDA, RATS entities require access to a Handle
   Distributor to which a trustable and synchronized time-source is
   available.  The Handle Distributor takes on the role of a Time Stamp
   Authority (TSA) to distribute Handles incorporating Time Stamp Tokens
   (TST) to the RATS entities.  RATS require an Attesting Environment
   that generates believable Evidence.  While a TPM is used as the
   corresponding root of trust in this specification, any other type of
   root of trust can be used with TUDA.

EAP typically runs directly over data link layers such as Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) or IEEE 802, without requiring IP. EAP provides its own support for duplicate elimination and retransmission, but is reliant on lower layer ordering guarantees. Fragmentation is not supported within EAP itself; however, individual EAP methods may support this. This document obsoletes RFC 2284.

This is done using manufacturer-installed X.509 certificates, in combination with a manufacturer's authorizing service, both online and offline. We call this process the Bootstrapping Remote Secure Key Infrastructure (BRSKI) protocol. Bootstrapping a new device can occur when using a routable address and a cloud service, only link-local connectivity, or limited/disconnected networks. Support for deployment models with less stringent security requirements is included. Bootstrapping is complete when the cryptographic identity of the new key infrastructure is successfully deployed to the device. The established secure connection can be used to deploy a locally issued certificate to the device as well.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-1">The TPM and surrounding ecosystem provide three interlocking capabilities to enable secure collection 
of evidence from a remote device: PCRs, a Quote mechanism, and a standardized Event Log.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-2">Each TPM has at least eight and at most twenty-four PCRs (depending on the profile and vendor choices), each one large 
enough to hold one hash value (SHA-1, SHA-256, and other hash algorithms can 
be used, depending on TPM version).  PCRs can't be accessed directly from outside the chip, but the TPM 
interface provides a way to "extend" a new security measurement hash into any PCR, a process by which the existing value 
in the PCR is hashed with the new security measurement hash, and the result placed back into the same PCR.  The result 
is a composite fingerprint comprising the hash of all the security measurements extended into each PCR since the system was reset.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-3">Every time a PCR is extended, an entry should be added to the corresponding Event Log.  Logs contain the security 
measurement hash plus informative fields offering hints as to which event generated the security measurement. 
The Event Log itself is protected against accidental manipulation, but it is implicitly tamper-evident:  Any 
verification process can read the security measurement hash from the log events, compute the composite value, 
and compare that to what is in the PCR.   If there's no discrepancy, the logs do provide an accurate 
view of what was placed into the PCR.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-4">Note that the composite hash-of-hashes recorded in PCRs is order-dependent, resulting in different PCR values for different 
ordering of the same set of events (e.g., Event A followed by Event B yields a different PCR value than B followed by A).
For single-threaded code, where both the events and their order are fixed, a Verifier may validate a single PCR value, and use the log only to diagnose a mismatch from Reference Values.  However, operating system code is usually 
nondeterministic, meaning that there may never be a single "known good" PCR value.  In this case, the Verifier may have
to verify that the log is correct, and then analyze each item in the log to determine if it represents an authorized event.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-5">In a conventional TPM Attestation environment, the first measurement must be made and extended into the TPM by trusted 
device code (called the RTM).  That first measurement should cover the segment of 
code that is run immediately after the RTM, which then measures the next code segment before running it, and so on, 
forming an unbroken chain of trust.  See <xref target="TCG-RT" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TCG-RT"/> for more on Mutable vs. Immutable Roots of Trust.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-6">The TPM provides another mechanism called a Quote that can read the current value of the PCRs and package them, 
along with the Verifier's nonce, into a TPM-specific data structure signed by an Attestation private key, known 
only to the TPM.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-7">It's important to note that the Quote data structure is signed inside the TPM (see <xref target="security-cons" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5"/>, Security Considerations).  The trust model is preserved by retrieving the Quote in a way that does not invalidate the signature, 
as specified in <xref target="RFC9684" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9684"/>.  The structure of the command and response for a quote, including its signature, as generated by the TPM, can be seen in Part 3, Section 16.5, of <xref target="TPM-1.2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TPM-1.2"/> and Section 18.4.2 of <xref target="TPM-2.0" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TPM-2.0"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-8">The Verifier uses the Quote and Log together.  The Quote contains the composite hash of the complete sequence 
of security measurement hashes, signed by the TPM's private AK.  The Log contains a record of each
measurement extended into the TPM's PCRs.  By computing the composite hash of all the measurements, the Verifier
can verify the integrity of the Event Log, even though the Event Log itself is not signed.  Each hash in the validated 
Event Log can then be compared to corresponding expected values in the set of Reference Values to 
validate overall system integrity.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.1-9">A summary of information exchanged in obtaining quotes from TPM 1.2 and TPM 2.0 can be found in <xref target="TAP" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TAP"/>, Section 4.
Detailed information about PCRs and Quote data structures can be found in <xref target="TPM-1.2" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TPM-1.2"/>, <xref target="TPM-2.0" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TPM-2.0"/>.  Recommended log

        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.2-1">The measurements needed for attestation require that the device being attested

the TPM PCRs) to record the results, and a Root of Trust

        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.2-2">While there are many complex aspects of Roots of Trust (<xref target="TCG-RT" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TCG-RT"/> <xref target="SP800-155" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="SP800-155"/> <xref target="SP800-193" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="SP800-193"/>), two aspects that

        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-appendix.a.2-4">The first measurement must be computed by code that is implicitly trusted; if that
