1.  Introduction

   DNSSEC is broadly defined in [RFC4033], [RFC4034], and [RFC4035].  It
   uses cryptographic keys and digital signatures to provide
   authentication of DNS data.  DNSSEC signature algorithms are
   registered in the DNSSEC algorithm numbers registry [IANA].

   This document defines the DNSKEY and RRSIG resource records (RRs) of
   new signing algorithms: SM2 uses elliptic curves over 256-bit prime
   fields with SM3 hash algorithm.  (A description of SM2 can be found
   in GM/T 0003.2-2012 [GMT-0003.2] or ISO/IEC14888-3:2018
   [ISO-IEC14888-3_2018], and a description of SM3 can be found in GM/T
   0004-2012 [GMT-0004] or ISO/IEC10118-3:2018 [ISO-IEC10118-3_2018].)
   This document also defines the DS RR for the SM3 one-way hash
   algorithm.  In the signing algorithm defined in this document, the
   size of the key for the elliptic curve is matched with the size of
   the output of the hash algorithm.  Both are 256 bits.

   Many implementations may not support SM2 signatures and SM3 digests.
   Section 5.2 of [RFC6840] specifies handling of answers in such cases.

   Caution: This specification is not a standard and does not have IETF
   community consensus.  It makes use of cryptographic algorithms that
   are national standards for China, as well as ISO/IEC standards (ISO/
   IEC 14888:3-2018 [ISO-IEC14888-3_2018] and ISO/IEC 10118:3-2018
   [ISO-IEC10118-3_2018]).  Neither the IETF nor the IRTF has analyzed
   that algorithm for suitability for any given application, and it may
   contain either intended or unintended weaknesses.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  SM3 DS Records

   The implementation of SM3 in DNSSEC follows the implementation of
   SHA-256 as specified in [RFC4509] except that the underlying
   algorithm is SM3 with digest type code 6.

   The generation of an SM3 hash value is described in Section 5 of
   [GMT-0004] and generates a 256-bit hash value.

3.  SM2 Parameters

   Verifying SM2 signatures requires agreement between the signer and
   the verifier on the parameters used.  The SM2 digital signature
   algorithm has been added to [ISO-IEC14888-3_2018].  The parameters of
   the curve used in this profile are as follows:

   p  = FFFFFFFE FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF
        FFFFFFFF 00000000 FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF
   a  = FFFFFFFE FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF
        FFFFFFFF 00000000 FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFC
   b  = 28E9FA9E 9D9F5E34 4D5A9E4B CF6509A7
        F39789F5 15AB8F92 DDBCBD41 4D940E93
   xG = 32C4AE2C 1F198119 5F990446 6A39C994
        8FE30BBF F2660BE1 715A4589 334C74C7
   yG = BC3736A2 F4F6779C 59BDCEE3 6B692153
        D0A9877C C62A4740 02DF32E5 2139F0A0
   n  = FFFFFFFE FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF
        7203DF6B 21C6052B 53BBF409 39D54123

4.  DNSKEY and RRSIG Resource Records for SM2

4.1.  DNSKEY Resource Records

   SM2 public keys consist of a single value, called "P".  In DNSSEC
   keys, P is a string of 64 octets that represents the uncompressed
   form of a curve point, "x | y".  (Conversion of a point to an octet
   string is described in Section 4.2.8 of [GMT-0003.1].)

4.2.  RRSIG Resource Records

   The SM2 signature is the combination of two non-negative integers,
   called "r" and "s".  The two integers, each of which is formatted as
   a simple octet string, are combined into a single longer octet string
   for DNSSEC as the concatenation "r | s".  (Conversion of the integers
   to bit strings is described in Section 4.2.1 of [GMT-0003.1].)  Each
   integer MUST be encoded as 32 octets.

   Process details are described in Section 6 of [GMT-0003.2].

   The algorithm number associated with the DNSKEY and RRSIG resource
   records is 17, which is described in the IANA Considerations section.

   Conformant implementations that create records to be put into the DNS
   MAY implement signing and verification for the SM2 digital signature
   algorithm.  Conformant DNSSEC verifiers MAY implement verification
   for the above algorithm.

5.  Support for NSEC3 Denial of Existence

   This document does not define algorithm aliases mentioned in
   [RFC5155].

   A DNSSEC validator that implements the signing algorithms defined in
   this document MUST be able to validate negative answers in the form
   of both NSEC and NSEC3 with hash algorithm SHA-1, as defined in
   [RFC5155].  An authoritative server that does not implement NSEC3 MAY
   still serve zones that use the signing algorithms defined in this
   document with NSEC denial of existence.

   If using NSEC3, the iterations MUST be 0 and salt MUST be an empty
   string as recommended in Section 3.1 of [RFC9276].

6.  Example

   The following is an example of SM2 keys and signatures in DNS zone
   file format, including DNSKEY RR, NSEC3PARAM RR, NSEC3 RR with RRSIG
   RRs, and DS RR.

7.  IANA Considerations

   within the "DNSSEC Delegation Signer (DS) Resource Record (RR) Type
   Digest Algorithms" registry group.

   * There has been no determination of standardization of the use of
   this algorithm with Transaction Security.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security strength of SM2 depends on the size of the key.  A
   longer key provides stronger security strength.  The security of ECC-
   based algorithms is influenced by the curve it uses, too.

   Like any cryptographic algorithm, it may come to pass that a weakness
   is found in either SM2 or SM3.  In this case, the proper remediation
   is crypto-agility.  In the case of DNSSEC, the appropriate approach
   would be to regenerate appropriate DS, DNSKEY, RRSIG, and NSEC3
   records.  Care MUST be taken in this situation to permit appropriate
   rollovers, taking into account record caching.  See [RFC7583] for
   details.  A suitable replacement algorithm should be both widely
   implemented and not known to have weaknesses.

   The security considerations listed in [RFC4509] apply here as well.
