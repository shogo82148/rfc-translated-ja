In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-3">The key words &quot;<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>&quot;, &quot;<bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>&quot;, &quot;<bcp14>REQUIRED</bcp14>&quot;, &quot;<bcp14>SHALL</bcp14>&quot;, &quot;<bcp14>SHALL NOT</bcp14>&quot;,
&quot;<bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14>&quot;, &quot;<bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14>&quot;, &quot;<bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>&quot;, &quot;<bcp14>MAY</bcp14>&quot;, and &quot;<bcp14>OPTIONAL</bcp14>&quot; in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-4">=== NEW ===
In many IETF documents, several words, when they are in all capitals
as shown below, are used to signify the requirements in the
specification.  These capitalized words can bring significant clarity
and consistency to documents because their meanings are well defined.
This document defines how those words are interpreted in IETF
documents when the words are in all capitals.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-5">o  These words can be used as defined here, but using them is not
   required.  Specifically, normative text does not require the use
   of these key words.  They are used for clarity and consistency
   when that is what's wanted, but a lot of normative text does not
   use them and is still normative.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-6">o  The words have the meanings specified herein only when they are in
   all capitals.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-7">o  When these words are not capitalized, they have their normal
   English meanings and are not affected by this document.</t>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL

   described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
