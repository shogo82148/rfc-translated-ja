The EVPN specifications\r\nallow a single P2MP tunnel to carry traffic of multiple Broadcast\r\nDomains (BDs).  These features require the ingress router of the P2MP\r\ntunnel to allocate an upstream-assigned MPLS label for each VPN or\r\nfor each BD.  A packet sent on a P2MP tunnel then carries the label\r\nthat is mapped to its VPN or BD (in some cases, a distinct\r\nupstream-assigned label is needed for each flow.) Since each ingress\r\nrouter allocates labels independently, with no coordination among the\r\ningress routers, the egress routers may need to keep track of a large\r\nnumber of labels.  The number of labels may need to be as large as,\r\nor larger than, the product of the number of ingress routers times\r\nthe number of VPNs or BDs. However, the number of labels can be\r\ngreatly reduced if the association between a label and a VPN or BD is\r\nmade by provisioning, so that all ingress routers assign the same\r\nlabel to a particular VPN or BD. New procedures are needed in order\r\nto take advantage of such provisioned labels. These new procedures\r\nalso apply to Multipoint-to-Multipoint (MP2MP) tunnels. This document\r\nupdates RFCs 6514, 7432, and 7582 by specifying the necessary\r\nprocedures.","pub_date":"May 2024","keywords":["DCB","Tunnel Aggregation"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC6514","RFC7432","RFC7582"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9573","errata_url":null}
