This document details this\r\nuse of the EDHOC protocol by specifying a number of additional and\r\noptional mechanisms, including an optimization approach for combining\r\nthe execution of EDHOC with the first OSCORE transaction. This\r\ncombination reduces the number of round trips required to set up an\r\nOSCORE Security Context and to complete an OSCORE transaction using\r\nthat Security Context.","pub_date":"November 2024","keywords":["security","key agreement","secure communication","constrained environments","AKE","lightweight authenticated key exchange","IoT security"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9668","errata_url":null}
