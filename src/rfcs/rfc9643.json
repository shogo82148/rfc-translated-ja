The modules include\r\nbasic parameters of a TCP connection relevant for client or server\r\napplications, as well as client configuration required for traversing\r\nproxies. The data models defined by these modules may be used\r\ndirectly (e.g., to define a specific TCP client or TCP server) or in\r\nconjunction with the configuration defined for higher level protocols\r\nthat depend on TCP (e.g., SSH, TLS, etc.).  Examples of higher level\r\nprotocol configuration designed to be used in conjunction with this\r\nconfiguration are in RFCs 9644 and 9645.","pub_date":"October 2024","keywords":["IETF"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9643","errata_url":null}
