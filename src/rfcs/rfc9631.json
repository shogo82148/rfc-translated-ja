Collectively, they are called\r\nthe Compact Routing Header (CRH). Individually, they are called\r\nCRH-16 and CRH-32.\r\n\r\nOne purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate that the CRH can be\r\nimplemented and deployed in a production network. Another purpose is\r\nto demonstrate that the security considerations described in this\r\ndocument can be addressed with Access Control Lists (ACLs). Finally,\r\nthis document encourages replication of the experiment.","pub_date":"August 2024","keywords":["IPv6","Routing header"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9631","errata_url":null}
