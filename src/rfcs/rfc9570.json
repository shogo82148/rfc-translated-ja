In\r\nactual deployments, the RAO was neither required nor used. \r\nFurthermore, RFC 6398 identifies security vulnerabilities associated\r\nwith the RAO in non-controlled environments, e.g., the case of using\r\nthe MPLS echo request\/reply as inter-area Operations, Administration,\r\nand Maintenance (OAM), and recommends against its use outside of\r\ncontrolled environments.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this document retires the RAO for MPLS OAM and updates RFC\r\n8029 to remove the RAO from LSP ping message encapsulations.\r\nFurthermore, this document explains why RFC 7506 has been\r\nreclassified as Historic.\r\n\r\nAlso, this document recommends the use of an IPv6 loopback address\r\n(::1\/128) as the IPv6 destination address for an MPLS echo request\r\nmessage.","pub_date":"May 2024","keywords":["LSP ping","router alert"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC8029"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9570","errata_url":null}
