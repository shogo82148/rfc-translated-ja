Specifically, this document defines a Content\r\nDelivery Network Interconnection (CDNI) Metadata interface object to\r\nenable delegation of X.509 certificates leveraging delegation schemes\r\ndefined in RFC 9115.  Per RFC 9115, delegating entities can remain in\r\nfull control of the delegation and can revoke it at any time. This\r\navoids the need to share private cryptographic key material between\r\nthe involved entities.","pub_date":"February 2024","keywords":["HTTPS","delegation","ACME","STAR"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9538","errata_url":null}
