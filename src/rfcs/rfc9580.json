OpenPGP\r\nprovides encryption with public key or symmetric cryptographic\r\nalgorithms, digital signatures, compression, and key management.\r\n\r\nThis document is maintained in order to publish all necessary\r\ninformation needed to develop interoperable applications based on the\r\nOpenPGP format. It is not a step-by-step cookbook for writing an\r\napplication. It describes only the format and methods needed to read,\r\ncheck, generate, and write conforming packets crossing any network.\r\nIt does not deal with storage and implementation questions. It does,\r\nhowever, discuss implementation issues necessary to avoid security\r\nflaws.\r\n\r\nThis document obsoletes RFCs 4880 (\"OpenPGP Message Format\"), 5581\r\n(\"The Camellia Cipher in OpenPGP\"), and 6637 (\"Elliptic Curve\r\nCryptography (ECC) in OpenPGP\").","pub_date":"July 2024","keywords":["encryption","digital signatures","key management","pgp"],"obsoletes":["RFC4880","RFC5581","RFC6637"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9580","errata_url":null}
