      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">This document describes protocol-independent methods called Explicit
Host-to-Network Flow Measurement Techniques that can be applicable to
transport-layer protocols between the client and server. These methods employ just a
few marking bits inside the header of each packet for performance measurements
and require the client and server to collaborate. Both endpoints cooperate by marking
packets and, possibly, mirroring the markings on the round-trip connection. The
techniques are especially valuable when applied to protocols that encrypt
transport headers since they enable loss and delay measurements by passive,
on-path network devices. This document describes several methods that can be
used separately or jointly depending of the availability of marking bits,
desired measurements, and properties of the protocol to which the methods are
applied.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">Packet loss and delay are hard and pervasive problems of day-to-day network
operation. Proactively detecting, measuring, and locating them is crucial to
maintaining high QoS and timely resolution of end-to-end throughput issues.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">Detecting and measuring packet loss and delay allows network operators to
independently confirm trouble reports and, ideally, be proactively notified of
developing problems on the network. Locating the cause of packet loss or
excessive delay is the first step to resolving problems and restoring QoS.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">Network operators wishing to perform quantitative measurement of
packet loss and delay have been heavily relying on information present in the
clear in transport-layer headers (e.g., TCP sequence and acknowledgment
numbers). By passively observing a network path at multiple points within one's
network, operators have been able to either quickly locate the source the
problem within their network or reliably attribute it to an upstream or
downstream network.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">With encrypted protocols, the transport-layer headers are encrypted and passive
packet loss and delay observations are not possible, as also noted in
<xref target="RFC9065" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TRANSPORT-ENCRYPT"/>. Nevertheless, accurate measurement of packet loss and
delay experienced by encrypted transport-layer protocols is highly desired,
especially by network operators who own or control the infrastructure between the
client and server.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">The measurement of loss and delay experienced by connections using an encrypted
protocol cannot be based on a measurement of loss and delay experienced by
connections between the same or similar endpoints that use an unencrypted
protocol because different protocols may utilize the network differently and be
routed differently by the network. Therefore, it is necessary to directly
measure the packet loss and delay experienced by users of encrypted protocols.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-6">The Alternate-Marking method <xref target="RFC9341" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="AltMark"/> defines a consolidated method to
perform packet loss, delay, and jitter measurements on live traffic. However,
as mentioned in <xref target="RFC9343" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IPv6AltMark"/>, <xref target="RFC9341" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="AltMark"/> mainly applies to a network-layer-controlled 
domain managed with a Network Management System (NMS), where the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE)
or the Provider Edge (PE) routers are the starting or the ending nodes. <xref target="RFC9341" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="AltMark"/> provides
measurement within a controlled domain in which the packets are
marked. Therefore, applying <xref target="RFC9341" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="AltMark"/> to end-to-end transport-layer
connections is not easy because packet identification and marking by network
nodes is prevented when encrypted transport-layer headers (e.g., QUIC, TCP with
TLS) are being used.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-7">This document defines Explicit Host-to-Network Flow Measurement Techniques that
are specifically designed for encrypted transport protocols. According to the
definitions of <xref target="RFC7799" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IPPM-METHODS"/>, these measurement methods can be classified as
Hybrid. They are to be embedded into a transport-layer protocol and are
explicitly intended for exposing delay and loss rate information to on-path
measurement devices. Unlike <xref target="RFC9341" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="AltMark"/>, most of these methods require
collaborative endpoint nodes. Since these measurement techniques make performance
information directly visible to the path, they do not rely on an external NMS.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-8">The Explicit Host-to-Network Flow Measurement Techniques described in this
document are applicable to any transport-layer protocol connecting a client and a
server. In this document, the client and the server are also referred to as the
endpoints of the transport-layer protocol.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-9">The different methods described in this document can be used alone or in
combination. Each technique uses few bits and exposes a specific measurement.
It is assumed that the endpoints are collaborative in the sense of the
measurements, indeed both the client and server need to cooperate.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-10">Following the recommendation in <xref target="RFC8558" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8558"/> of making path signals explicit,
this document proposes adding some dedicated measurement bits to the clear
portion of the transport protocol headers. These bits can be added to an
unencrypted portion of a transport-layer header, e.g., UDP surplus space (see
<xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-options" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="UDP-OPTIONS"/> and <xref target="I-D.herbert-udp-space-hdr" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="UDP-SURPLUS"/>) or reserved bits in a QUIC v1 header, as
already done with the latency Spin bit (see 
<xref target="RFC9000" sectionFormat="of" section="17.4" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-17.4" derivedContent="QUIC-TRANSPORT"/>). Note that this document does not recommend the use of any
specific bits, as these would need to be chosen by the specific protocol
implementations (see <xref target="applications" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 5"/>).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-11">The Spin bit, Delay bit, and loss bits explained in this document are inspired by
<xref target="RFC9341" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="AltMark"/>, <xref target="RFC9312" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="QUIC-MANAGEABILITY"/>, <xref target="I-D.trammell-quic-spin" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="QUIC-SPIN"/>, <xref target="I-D.trammell-tsvwg-spin" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TSVWG-SPIN"/>,

the marking mechanism (e.g., 1 second, which usually is greater than the max
expected RTT). The second alternative requires a dynamic mechanism able to
adapt the duration of the <tt>T_Max</tt> to the delay of the connection (<tt>T_Max_c</tt>).</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.3-4">For instance, the client and observers could use the connection RTT as a basis for
calculating an effective <tt>T_Max</tt>. They should use a predetermined initial value

measured, change <tt>T_Max</tt> accordingly so that <tt>T_Max = T_Max_c</tt>. In any case, the
selected <tt>T_Max</tt> should be large enough to absorb any possible variations in the
connection delay. This also helps to prevent the mechanism from failing when the
observer cannot recognize sudden changes in RTT exceeding <tt>T_Max</tt>.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.3-5"><tt>T_Max_c</tt> could be computed as two times the measured <tt>RTT</tt> plus a fixed amount
of time (100 ms) to prevent low <tt>T_Max</tt> values in the case of very small RTTs.
The resulting formula is: <tt>T_Max_c = 2RTT + 100 ms</tt>. If <tt>T_Max_c</tt> is greater than
<tt>T_Max_p</tt>, then <tt>T_Max_c</tt> is forced to the <tt>T_Max_p</tt> value.
Note that the value of 100 ms is provided as an example, and it may be chosen
differently depending on the specific scenarios. For instance, an implementer may
consider using existing protocol-specific values if appropriate.</t>

client's <tt>T_Max</tt> to avoid considering as a valid measurement what is actually
the client's <tt>T_Max</tt>. To obtain this result, the client waits for two
consecutive incoming samples and computes the two related RTTs. Then it takes
the largest of them as the basis of the <tt>T_Max_c</tt> formula. At this point,
observers have already measured a valid RTT and then computed their <tt>T_Max_c</tt>.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2-1">The round-Trip loss signal requires a working Spin bit signal to separate trains
of marked packets (packets with T bit set to 1).  A "pause" of at least one
empty Spin bit period between each phase of the algorithm serves as such a
separator for the on-path observer. The connection between T bit and Spin bit
helps the observer correlate packet trains.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2-2">The client maintains a "generation token" count that is set to zero at the
beginning of the session and is incremented every time a packet is received
(marked or unmarked). The client also maintains a "reflection counter" that
starts at zero at the beginning of the session.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2-3">The client is in charge of launching trains of marked packets and does so
according to the algorithm:</t>
          <ol spacing="normal" type="1" indent="adaptive" start="1" pn="section-3.1.2-4"><li pn="section-3.1.2-4.1" derivedCounter="1.">Generation Phase. The client starts generating marked packets for two
consecutive Spin bit periods. When the client transmits a packet and a
"generation token" is available, the client marks the packet and retires a
"generation token". If no token is available, the outgoing packet is
transmitted unmarked.  At the end of the first Spin bit period spent in
generation, the reflection counter is unlocked to start counting incoming
marked packets that will be reflected later.</li>
            <li pn="section-3.1.2-4.2" derivedCounter="2.">Pause Phase. When the generation is completed, the client pauses till it has
observed one entire Spin bit period with no marked packets.  That Spin bit
period is used by the observer as a separator between generated and
reflected packets.  During this marking pause, all the outgoing packets are
transmitted with T bit set to 0.  The reflection counter is still
incremented every time a marked packet arrives.</li>
            <li pn="section-3.1.2-4.3" derivedCounter="3.">Reflection Phase. The client starts transmitting marked packets,
decrementing the reflection counter for each transmitted marked packet until
the reflection counter has reached zero. The "generation token" method from the
Generation Phase is used during this phase as well.  At the end of the first
Spin bit period spent in reflection, the reflection counter is locked to avoid
incoming reflected packets incrementing it.</li>
            <li pn="section-3.1.2-4.4" derivedCounter="4.">Pause Phase 2. The Pause Phase is repeated after the Reflection Phase and
serves as a separator between the reflected packet train and a new packet
train.</li>
          </ol>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2-5">The generation token counter should be capped to limit the effects of a
subsequent sudden reduction in the other endpoint's packet rate that could
prevent that endpoint from reflecting collected packets. A
cap value of 1 is recommended.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2-6">A server maintains a "marking counter" that starts at zero and is incremented
every time a marked packet arrives. When the server transmits a packet and the
"marking counter" is positive, the server marks the packet and decrements the
"marking counter". If the "marking counter" is zero, the outgoing packet is
transmitted unmarked.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.2-7">Note that a choice of 2 RTT (two Spin bit periods) for the Generation Phase is a
trade-off between the percentage of marked packets (i.e., the percentage of
traffic monitored) and the measurement delay. Using this value, the algorithm
produces a measurement approximately every 6 RTT (2 generations, ~2
reflections, 2 pauses), marking ~1/3 of packets exchanged in the slower
direction (see <xref target="tbit-losscov" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.1.4"/>). Choosing a Generation Phase of 1 RTT, we would
produce measurements every 4 RTT, monitoring ~1/4 of packets in the
slower direction.</t>

rate suddenly changes, but the mechanism described here

the Q bit represents the "packet color" that can be switched between 0 and 1 in order to mark consecutive blocks

on whether the color is switched according to a fixed timer or after a fixed
number of packets. Cooperating and synchronized observers on either end of a network 
segment can use the fixed-timer method to measure packet loss on the
segment by comparing packet counters for the same packet blocks.  The time length of
the blocks can be chosen depending on the desired measurement frequency, but it
must be long enough to guarantee the proper operation with respect to clock errors
and network delay issues.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-3">The Q bit method described in this document chooses the color-switching method
based on a fixed number of packets for each block. This approach has the
advantage that it does not require cooperating or synchronized observers or
network elements. Each probe can measure packet loss autonomously without
relying on an external NMS. For the purpose of the
packet loss measurement, all blocks have the same number of packets, and it is
necessary to detect only the loss event and not to identify the exact block with
losses.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2-4">Following the method based on fixed number of packets, the square wave signal is
generated by the switching of the Q bit: every outgoing packet contains the Q
bit value, which is initialized to 0 and inverted after sending N packets (a
sQuare Block or simply Q Block). Hence, Q Period is 2*N.</t>

two alternatives to selecting the Q Block length. The first one requires that
the length is known a priori and therefore set within the protocol
specifications that implement the marking mechanism. The second requires the

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.2.1-2">In this latter scenario, the sender is expected to choose N (Q Block
length) based on the expected amount of loss and reordering on the
path.  The choice of N strikes a compromise -- the observation could
become too unreliable in case of packet reordering and/or severe loss
if N is too small, while short flows may not yield a useful upstream

losses of less than two blocks (e.g., less than 128 packets for a Q Block length

Spin bit to the first byte of the short packet header, leaving two reserved bits
for future use (see <xref target="RFC9000" sectionFormat="of" section="17.2.2" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-17.2.2" derivedContent="QUIC-TRANSPORT"/>).</t>

the monitoring of the interconnections inside a data center (Intra-DC), between
data centers (Inter-DC), as well as end-to-end large-scale data transfers.  For
the application of the methods described in this document, it is assumed that
the monitored flows follow stable paths and traverse the same measurement
points.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-5-3">The specific implementation details and the choice of the bits used for the
experiments with QUIC and TCP are out of scope for this document.  A
specification defining the specific protocol application is expected to discuss
the implementation details depending on which bits will be implemented in the
protocol, e.g., <xref target="I-D.ietf-core-coap-pm" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="CORE-COAP-PM"/>. If bits used for specific
measurements can also be used for other purposes by a protocol, the

the signals or to discuss limitations on the conditions under which the
observers can expect a valid signal.</t>

the protocol designers could decide that a fraction of flows should not encode
loss and delay information, and instead, the bits would be set to arbitrary

      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-1">The methods described in this document are transport agnostic and potentially
applicable to any transport-layer protocol, and especially valuable for encrypted
protocols. These methods can be applied to both limited domains and the Internet,
depending on the specific protocol application.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-2">Passive loss and delay observations have been a part of the network operations
for a long time, so exposing loss and delay information to the network does not
add new security concerns for protocols that are currently observable.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-3">In the absence of packet loss, Q and R bits signals do not provide any
information that cannot be observed by simply counting packets transiting a
network path. In the presence of packet loss, Q and R bits will disclose
the loss, but this is information about the environment and not the endpoint
state. The L bit signal discloses internal state of the protocol's loss-detection 
machinery, but this state can often be gleaned by timing packets and
observing the congestion controller response.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-4">The measurements described in this document do not imply that new packets injected
into the network can cause potential harm to the network itself and to data
traffic. The measurements could be harmed by an attacker altering the marking
of the packets or injecting artificial traffic. Authentication techniques may be
used where appropriate to guard against these traffic attacks.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-5">Hence, loss bits do not provide a viable new mechanism to attack data integrity

information as a covert channel.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-7-7">This document does not define a specific application, and the described
techniques can generally apply to different communication protocols operating in
different security environments. A specification defining a specific protocol
application is expected to address the respective security considerations and
must consider specifics of the protocol and its expected operating environment.
For example, security considerations for QUIC, discussed in 
<xref target="RFC9000" sectionFormat="of" section="21" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-21" derivedContent="QUIC-TRANSPORT"/> and <xref target="RFC9001" sectionFormat="of" section="9" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9001#section-9" derivedContent="QUIC-TLS"/>, consider a possibility of
active and passive attackers in the network as well as attacks on specific QUIC
mechanisms.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-1">A defense against an optimistic ACK attack, described in 
<xref target="RFC9000" sectionFormat="of" section="21.4" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000#section-21.4" derivedContent="QUIC-TRANSPORT"/>, involves a sender randomly skipping packet numbers to detect
a receiver acknowledging packet numbers that have never been received. The Q bit
signal may inform the attacker which packet numbers were skipped on purpose and
which had been actually lost (and are, therefore, safe for the attacker to
acknowledge). To use the Q bit for this purpose, the attacker must first receive
at least an entire Q Block of packets, which renders the attack ineffective
against a delay-sensitive congestion controller.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-2">A protocol that is more susceptible to an optimistic ACK attack with the loss
signal provided by the Q bit and that uses a loss-based congestion controller should
shorten the current Q Block by the number of skipped packets numbers. For example,
skipping a single packet number will invert the square signal one outgoing
packet sooner.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.1-3">Similar considerations apply to the R bit, although a shortened Reflection Block along
with a matching skip in packet numbers does not necessarily imply a lost
packet, since it could be due to a lost packet on the reverse path along with a
deliberately skipped packet by the sender.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-1">Theoretically, delay measurements can be used to roughly evaluate the distance
of the client from the server (using the RTT) or from any intermediate observer
(using the client-observer half-RTT). As described in <xref target="RTT-PRIVACY" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RTT-PRIVACY"/>, connection
RTT measurements for geolocating endpoints are usually inferior to even the
most basic IP geolocation databases. It is the variability within RTT
measurements (the jitter) that is most informative, as it can provide insight
into the operating environment of the endpoints as well as the state of the
networks (queuing delays) used by the connection.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-2">Nevertheless, to further mask the actual RTT of the connection, the Delay bit
algorithm can be slightly modified by, for example, delaying the client-side
reflection of the delay sample by a fixed, randomly chosen time value. This
would lead an intermediate observer to measure a delay greater than the real
one.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-3">This Additional Delay should be randomly selected by the client and kept
constant for a certain amount of time across multiple connections. This ensures
that the client-server jitter remains the same as if no Additional Delay had
been inserted. For example, a new Additional Delay value could be generated
whenever the client's IP address changes.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-4">Despite the Additional Delay, this Hidden Delay technique still allows an
accurate measurement of the RTT components (observer-server) and all the
intra-domain measurements used to distribute the delay in the network.
Furthermore, unlike the Delay bit, the Hidden Delay bit does not require the
use of the client reflection threshold (1 ms by default). Removing this
threshold may lead to increasing the number of valid measurements produced by
the algorithm.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-7.2-5">Note that the Hidden Delay bit does not affect an observer's ability to measure
accurate RTT using other means, such as timing packets exchanged during the
connection establishment.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-2">New protocols commonly have specific privacy goals, and loss reporting must
ensure that loss information does not compromise those privacy goals. For

implementation would need to reset all counters when it changes the destination
(IP address or UDP port) or the Connection ID used for outgoing packets. It
would also need to avoid incrementing the Unreported Loss counter for loss of
packets sent to a different destination or with a different Connection ID.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-3">It is also worth highlighting that, if these techniques are not widely deployed,
an endpoint that uses them may be fingerprinted based on their usage.
However, since there is no release of user data, the techniques seem unlikely to
substantially increase the existing privacy risks.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-4">Furthermore, if there is experimental traffic with these bits set on the network,
a network operator could potentially prioritize this marked traffic by placing it
in a priority queue. This may result in the delivery of better service, which

For example, TCP's state machine uses a series of well-known messages that are exchanged in the clear. Because these are visible to network elements on the path between the two nodes setting up the transport connection, they are often used as signals by those network elements. In transports that do not exchange these messages in the clear, on-path network elements lack those signals. Often, the removal of those signals is intended by those moving the messages to confidential channels. Where the endpoints desire that network elements along the path receive these signals, this document recommends explicit signals be used.</t>

              <t indent="0">Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a mechanism where network nodes can mark IP packets instead of dropping them to indicate incipient congestion to the endpoints. Receivers with an ECN-capable transport protocol feed back this information to the sender. ECN was originally specified for TCP in such a way that only one feedback signal can be transmitted per Round-Trip Time (RTT). Recent new TCP mechanisms like Congestion Exposure (ConEx), Data Center TCP (DCTCP) or Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) need more accurate ECN feedback information whenever more than one marking is received in one RTT. This document updates the original ECN specification in RFC 3168 to specify a scheme that provides more than one feedback signal per RTT in the TCP header. Given TCP header space is scarce, it allocates a reserved header bit previously assigned to the ECN-Nonce. It also overloads the two existing ECN flags in the TCP header. The resulting extra space is exploited to feed back the IP-ECN field received during the 3-way handshake as well. Supplementary feedback information can optionally be provided in two new TCP option alternatives, which are never used on the TCP SYN. The document also specifies the treatment of this updated TCP wire protocol by middleboxes.</t>

              <t indent="0">This document describes an abstract mechanism by which senders inform the network about the congestion recently encountered by packets in the same flow. Today, network elements at any layer may signal congestion to the receiver by dropping packets or by Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) markings, and the receiver passes this information back to the sender in transport-layer feedback. The mechanism described here enables the sender to also relay this congestion information back into the network in-band at the IP layer, such that the total amount of congestion from all elements on the path is revealed to all IP elements along the path, where it could, for example, be used to provide input to traffic management. This mechanism is called Congestion Exposure, or ConEx. The companion document, "Congestion Exposure (ConEx) Concepts and Use Cases" (RFC 6789), provides the entry point to the set of ConEx documentation.</t>
