EVC was developed by the MPEG. The RTP payload format allows\r\nfor the packetization of one or more Network Abstraction Layer (NAL)\r\nunits in each RTP packet payload and the fragmentation of a NAL unit\r\ninto multiple RTP packets. The payload format has broad applicability\r\nin videoconferencing, Internet video streaming, and high-bitrate\r\nentertainment-quality video, among other applications.","pub_date":"June 2024","keywords":["EVC","ISO\/IEC 23094-1","Essential Video Coding"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9584","errata_url":null}
