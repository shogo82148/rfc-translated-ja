Implementation of the SendHoldTimer\r\nhelps overcome situations where a BGP connection is not terminated\r\nafter the local system detects that the remote system is not\r\nprocessing BGP messages.  This document specifies that the local\r\nsystem should close the BGP connection and not solely rely on the\r\nremote system for connection closure when the SendHoldTimer expires.\r\nThis document updates RFC 4271.","pub_date":"November 2024","keywords":["BGP","TCP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC4271"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9687","errata_url":null}
