TIPS uses\r\nan incremental RESTful design to give an ALTO client the new\r\ncapability to explicitly and concurrently (in a non-blocking manner)\r\nrequest (or pull) specific incremental updates using HTTP\/2 or\r\nHTTP\/3, while still functioning for HTTP\/1.1.","pub_date":"September 2024","keywords":["incremental update"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9569","errata_url":null}
