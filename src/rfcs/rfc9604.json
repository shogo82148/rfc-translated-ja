It is possible to\r\nassociate a BSID to an RSVP-TE-signaled Traffic Engineering (TE)\r\nLabel Switched Path (LSP) or an SR TE path. The BSID can be used by\r\nan upstream node for steering traffic into the appropriate TE path to\r\nenforce SR policies. This document specifies the concept of binding\r\nvalue, which can be either an MPLS label or a Segment Identifier\r\n(SID). It further specifies an extension to Path Computation Element\r\nCommunication Protocol (PCEP) for reporting the binding value by a\r\nPath Computation Client (PCC) to the Path Computation Element (PCE)\r\nto support PCE-based TE policies.","pub_date":"August 2024","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9604","errata_url":null}
