      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-1">Home network owners may have devices or services hosted on their home network that they wish to access from the Internet (i.e., from a network outside of the home network). Home networks are increasingly numbered using IPv6 addresses, which in principle makes this access simpler, but accessing home networks from the Internet requires the names and IP addresses of these devices and services to be made available in the public DNS.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-abstract-2">This document describes how a Home Naming Authority (NHA) instructs the outsourced infrastructure to publish these pieces of information in the public DNS. 
The names and IP addresses of the home network are set in the Public Homenet Zone by the Homenet Naming Authority (HNA), which in turn instructs an outsourced infrastructure to publish the zone on behalf of the home network owner.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">Home network owners may have devices or services hosted on their home network
that they wish to access from the Internet (i.e., from a network outside of the
home network).
The use of IPv6 addresses in the home makes, in principle, the actual network access simpler, while on the other hand, the addresses are much harder to remember and are subject to regular renumbering.
To make this situation simpler for typical home owners to manage, there needs to be an easy way for the names and IP addresses of these devices and services to be published in the public DNS.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">As depicted in <xref target="fig-outsourcing-overview" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Figure 1"/>, the names and IP address of the home network are made available in the Public Homenet Zone by the Homenet Naming Authority (HNA), which in turn instructs the DNS Outsourcing Infrastructure (DOI) to publish the zone on behalf of the HNA.
This document describes how an HNA can instruct a DOI to publish a Public Homenet Zone on its behalf.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-6">The Synchronization Channel is a zone transfer, with the HNA configured as a primary server and the Distribution Manager configured as a secondary server.
Some operators refer to this kind of configuration as a "hidden primary", but that term is not used in this document as it is not precisely defined anywhere, but it has many slightly different meanings to many.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-7">The Control Channel (see <xref target="sec-ctrl" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/>) is used to set up the Synchronization Channel.
      This channel is in the form of a dynamic DNS update process, authenticated by TLS.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-8">For example, to build the Public Homenet Zone, the HNA needs the authoritative servers (and associated IP addresses) of the DOI's servers (the visible primaries) that are actually serving the zone.
Similarly, the DOI needs to know the IP address of the (hidden) primary (HNA) as well as potentially the hash of the Key Signing Key (KSK) in the DS RRset to secure the DNSSEC delegation with the parent zone.</t>

In both cases, these configuration aspects are out of the scope of this document.</t>

Zero configuration can only be achieved under some circumstances, and <xref target="RFC9527" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9527"/> provides one such example under the assumption that the ISP provides the DOI. <xref target="sec-cpe-vendor" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.1"/> describes another variant where the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) is provided preconfigured with the DOI.
<xref target="sec-agnostic-cpe" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.2"/> describes how an agnostic CPE may be configured by the home network administrator.
      Of course even in this case, the configuration can leverage mechanisms to prevent the end user from manually entering all information.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-4">On the other hand, provisioning the Public Homenet Zone needs to combine the ability to closely reflect what the end user wishes to publish on the Internet while easing such interaction.
The HNA may implement such interactions using web-based GUIs or specific mobile applications.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-5">With the CPE configured with the DOI, the HNA contacts the DOI to build a template for the
Public Homenet Zone and then provisions the Public Homenet Zone.

In the case where the HNA is a CPE, outsourcing to the DOI reduces the attack surface of the home network to DDoS, for example.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-12">Resolution is performed by DNS Resolvers.
When the resolution is performed outside the home network, the DNS Resolver resolves the DS record on the Global DNS and the name associated with the Public Homenet Zone (myhome.example) on the Public Authoritative Servers.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-5.1-13">In order to provide resilience to the Public Homenet Zone in case of WAN connectivity disruption, the Homenet DNS Resolver <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> be able to perform the resolution on the Homenet Authoritative Servers.
Note that the use of the Homenet DNS Resolver enhances privacy since the user on the home network would no longer be leaking interactions with internal services to an external DNS provider and to an on-path observer.
These servers are not expected to be mentioned in the Public Homenet Zone nor to be accessible from the Internet.
As such, their information as well as the corresponding signed DS record <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> be provided by the HNA to the Homenet DNS Resolvers, e.g., by using the Home Networking Control Protocol (HNCP) <xref target="RFC7788" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7788"/> or by configuring a trust anchor <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-dnssec-validator-requirements" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DRO-RECS"/>.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-1">The Public Homenet Reverse Zone works similarly to the Public Homenet Zone.
The main difference is that the ISP that provides the IPv6 connectivity is likely to also be the owner of the corresponding IPv6 reverse zone who administrates the Reverse Public Authoritative Servers. The configuration and the setting of the Synchronization Channel and Control Channel can largely be automated using DHCPv6 messages that are a part of the IPv6 prefix delegation process.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-2">The Public Homenet Zone is associated with a Registered Homenet Domain, and the ownership of that domain requires a specific registration from the end user as well as the HNA being provisioned with some authentication credentials.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-3">In this case, the HNA may be authenticated by the physical link layer, in which case the authentication of the HNA may be performed without additional provisioning of the HNA.
While this may not be so common for the Public Homenet Zone, this situation is expected to be quite common for the Reverse Homenet Zone as the ISP owns the IP address or IP prefix.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-4">More specifically, a common case is that the upstream ISP provides the IPv6 prefix to the Homenet with an identity association for a prefix delegation (IA_PD) option <xref target="RFC8415" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8415"/> and manages the DOI of the associated reverse zone.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-5">This leaves a place for setting up the relation between the HNA and DOI automatically as described in <xref target="RFC9527" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9527"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-6">In the case of the reverse zone, the DOI authenticates the source of the updates by IPv6 ACLs, and the ISP knows exactly what addresses have been delegated. Therefore, the HNA <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> always originate Synchronization Channel updates from an IP address within the zone that is being updated. Exceptionally, the Synchronization Channel might be from a different zone delegated to the HNA (if there were multiple zones or renumbering events were in progress).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-7">For example, if the ISP has assigned 2001:db8:f00d:1234::/64 to the WAN interface (by DHCPv6 or PPP with Router Advertisement (RA)), then the HNA should originate Synchronization Channel updates from, for example, 2001:db8:f00d:1234::2.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-8">If an ISP has delegated 2001:db8:aeae::/56 to the HNA via DHCPv6-PD, then the HNA should originate Synchronization Channel updates to an IP address within that subnet, such as 2001:db8:aeae:1::2.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-9">With this relation automatically configured, the synchronization between the Home network and the DOI happens in a similar way to the synchronization of the Public Homenet Zone described earlier in this document.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-10-10">Note that for home networks connected to multiple ISPs, each ISP provides only the DOI of the reverse zones associated with the delegated prefix.

In the make-before-break renumbering scenario, the new prefix is advertised, and the network is configured to prepare the transition to the new prefix. During a period of time, the two prefixes (old and new) coexist before the old prefix is completely removed. New resource records containing the new prefix <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be published, while the old resource records with the old prefixes <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be withdrawn. If the HNA anticipates that the period of overlap will be long (perhaps due to the knowledge of router and DHCPv6 lifetimes), it <bcp14>MAY</bcp14> publish the old prefixes with a significantly lower TTL.</t>

As explained in <xref target="RFC8978" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8978"/>, some flash renumberings occur due to power cycling of the HNA, where ISPs do not properly remember what prefixes have been assigned to which user.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-12-6">An HNA that boots up <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> immediately use the Control Channel to update the location for the Synchronization Channel.

      <t indent="0" pn="section-12-7">The HNA will have a list of names that should be published, but it might not yet have IP addresses for those devices. This could be because at the time of power on, the other devices were not yet online.

      <name slugifiedName="name-privacy-considerations">Privacy Considerations</name>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-13-1">Outsourcing the DNS Authoritative service from the HNA to a third party raises a few privacy-related concerns.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-13-2">The Public Homenet Zone lists the names of services hosted in the home network.
Combined with blocking of AXFR queries, the use of NSEC3 <xref target="RFC5155" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5155"/> (vs. NSEC <xref target="RFC4034" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4034"/>) prevents an  attacker from being able to walk the zone to discover all the names.
However, recent work <xref target="GPUNSEC3" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="GPUNSEC3"/> <xref target="ZONEENUM" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ZONEENUM"/> has shown that the protection provided by NSEC3 against dictionary attacks should be considered cautiously, and <xref target="RFC9276" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9276"/> provides guidelines to configure NSEC3 properly. In addition, the attacker may be able to walk the reverse DNS zone or use other reconnaissance techniques to learn this information as described in <xref target="RFC7707" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7707"/>.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-13-3">The zone may be also exposed during the synchronization between the primary and the secondary. The casual risk of this occurring is low, and the use of <xref target="RFC9103" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9103"/> significantly reduces this. Even if DNS zone transfer over TLS <xref target="RFC9103" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9103"/> is used by the DOI, it may still leak the existence of the zone through Notifies. The protocol described in this document does not increase that risk, as all Notifies use the encrypted Control Channel.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-13-4">In general, a home network owner is expected to publish only names for which there is some need to reference them externally. Publication of the name does not imply that the service is necessarily reachable from any or all parts of the Internet. <xref target="RFC7084" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7084"/> mandates that the outgoing-only policy <xref target="RFC6092" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6092"/> be available, and in many cases, it is configured by default.
A well-designed user interface would combine a policy for making a service public by a name with a policy on who may access it.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-13-5">In many cases, and for privacy reasons, the home network owner has wanted to publish names only for services that they will be able to access. The access control may consist of an IP source address range, or access may be restricted via some VPN functionality. The main advantages of publishing the names are that the service may be accessed by the same name both within and outside the home, and the DNS resolution can be handled similarly both within and outside the home. This considerably eases the ability to use VPNs where the VPN can be chosen according to the IP address of the service. Typically, a user may configure its device to reach its Homenet devices via a VPN while the remaining traffic is accessed directly.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-13-6">Enterprise networks have generally adopted another strategy designated as split-horizon-DNS. While such strategy might appear as providing more privacy at first sight, its implementation remains challenging and the privacy advantages need to be considered carefully. In split-horizon-DNS, names are designated with internal names that can only be resolved within the corporate network. When such strategy is applied to the homenet, VPNs need to be configured with naming resolution policies and routing policies. Such an approach might be reasonable with a single VPN, but maintaining a coherent DNS space and IP space among various VPNs comes with serious complexities. Firstly, if multiple homenets are using the same domain name -- like home.arpa -- it becomes difficult to determine on which network the resolution should be performed. As a result, homenets should at least be differentiated by a domain name. Secondly, the use of split-horizon-DNS requires each VPN to be associated with a resolver and specific resolutions to be performed by the dedicated resolver. Such policies can easily raise some conflicts (with significant privacy issues) while remaining hard to be implemented.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-13-7">In addition to the Public Homenet Zone, pervasive DNS monitoring can also monitor the traffic associated with the Public Homenet Zone.
This traffic may provide an indication of the services an end user accesses, plus how and when they use these services. Although, caching may obfuscate this information inside the home network, it is likely that this information will not be cached outside the home network.</t>

	This exposes the home network to attackers because names are expected to include less entropy than IP addresses. IPv4 addresses are 4-bytes long leading to 2<sup>32</sup> possibilities.
With IPv6 addresses, the Interface Identifier is 64-bits long leading to up to 2<sup>64</sup> possibilities  for a given subnetwork. This is not to mention that the subnet prefix is also 64-bits long, thus providing up to 2<sup>64</sup> possibilities.

However, home networks are not expected to be assigned a time-invariant prefix by ISPs.

As a result, observing IP addresses only provides some ephemeral information about who is accessing the service. On the other hand, names are not expected to be as volatile as IP addresses.

If an attacker can get access to one of them, it is likely that they will access both of them.
If the HNA is run in a home router with a secure element (SE) or trusted platform module (TPM), storing the private keys in the secure element would be a useful precaution. The DNSSEC keys are generally needed on an hourly to weekly basis, but not more often.</t>

              <t indent="0">   The DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) defines a process for validating
   received data and assert them authentic and complete as opposed to
   forged.

   While DNSSEC comes with some complexity, at least for non expert,
   that complexity is mostly abstracted by the resolver.  As result,
   running a resolver with DNSSEC enabled only requires the operator to
   only follow a very limited set of recommendations.  This document
   provides such recommendations.

              <t indent="0">To participate in wide-area IP networking, a host needs to be configured with IP addresses for its interfaces, either manually by the user or automatically from a source on the network such as a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server. Unfortunately, such address configuration information may not always be available. It is therefore beneficial for a host to be able to depend on a useful subset of IP networking functions even when no address configuration is available. This document describes how a host may automatically configure an interface with an IPv4 address within the 169.254/16 prefix that is valid for communication with other devices connected to the same physical (or logical) link.</t>
              <t indent="0">IPv4 Link-Local addresses are not suitable for communication with devices not directly connected to the same physical (or logical) link, and are only used where stable, routable addresses are not available (such as on ad hoc or isolated networks). This document does not recommend that IPv4 Link-Local addresses and routable addresses be configured simultaneously on the same interface. [STANDARDS-TRACK]</t>

It also uses other IPv6 features to minimize the effort and time required to complete the transition from the old prefix to the new prefix.

The architecture describes the need for specific protocol extensions for certain additional functionality.

              <t indent="0">IPv6 offers a much larger address space than that of its IPv4 counterpart. An IPv6 subnet of size /64 can (in theory) accommodate approximately 1.844 * 10^19 hosts, thus resulting in a much lower host density (#hosts/#addresses) than is typical in IPv4 networks, where a site typically has 65,000 or fewer unique addresses. As a result, it is widely assumed that it would take a tremendous effort to perform address-scanning attacks against IPv6 networks; therefore, IPv6 address-scanning attacks have been considered unfeasible. This document formally obsoletes RFC 5157, which first discussed this assumption, by providing further analysis on how traditional address-scanning techniques apply to IPv6 networks and exploring some additional techniques that can be employed for IPv6 network reconnaissance.</t>

Thus, certification authorities (CAs) in the Web PKI are trusted to verify that an applicant for a certificate legitimately represents the domain name(s) in the certificate. As of this writing, this verification is done through a collection of ad hoc mechanisms. This document describes a protocol that a CA and an applicant can use to automate the process of verification and certificate issuance. The protocol also provides facilities for other certificate management functions, such as certificate revocation.</t>

              <t indent="0">Misissued public-key certificates can prevent TLS clients from appropriately authenticating the TLS server. Several alternatives have been proposed to detect this situation and prevent a client from establishing a TLS session with a TLS end point authenticated with an illegitimate public-key certificate. These mechanisms are either not widely deployed or limited to public web browsing.</t>
              <t indent="0">This document proposes experimental extensions to TLS with opaque pinning tickets as a way to pin the server's identity. During an initial TLS session, the server provides an original encrypted pinning ticket. In subsequent TLS session establishment, upon receipt of the pinning ticket, the server proves its ability to decrypt the pinning ticket and thus the ownership of the pinning protection key. The client can now safely conclude that the TLS session is established with the same TLS server as the original TLS session. One of the important properties of this proposal is that no manual management actions are required.</t>

array of addresses is permitted. This parameter is optional, and if unspecified, the CPE uses the IP addresses provided by the dm parameter either directly when the dm indicates the IP address(es) returned by the DNS or DNSSEC resolution when dm indicates an FQDN.

	<li pn="section-appendix.b-16.1" derivedCounter="1.">The forward zone outsourcing may be provided by the maker of the Homenet router.
In this case, the identity and authorization could be built in the device at the manufacturer provisioning time. The device would need to be provisioned with a device-unique credential, and it is likely that the Registered Homenet Domain would be derived from a public attribute of the device, such as a serial number (see <xref target="sec-ex-manu" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Appendix C"/> or <xref target="I-D.richardson-homerouter-provisioning" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="HOMEROUTER-PROVISION"/> for more details).</li>

In this case, the use of <xref target="RFC9527" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9527"/> to provide the credentials is appropriate.</li>

In this case, the use of the JSON-serialized YANG data model described in this section is appropriate, as it can easily be copy and pasted by the user or downloaded as part of a web transaction.</li>
