Dogra"],"format":["HTML","TEXT","PDF","XML"],"page_count":"35","pub_status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","status":"PROPOSED STANDARD","source":"Routing Area Working Group","abstract":"This document defines version 3 of the Virtual Router Redundancy\r\nProtocol (VRRP) for IPv4 and IPv6. It obsoletes RFC 5798, which\r\npreviously specified VRRP (version 3). RFC 5798 obsoleted RFC 3768,\r\nwhich specified VRRP (version 2) for IPv4. VRRP specifies an election\r\nprotocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a Virtual Router\r\nto one of the VRRP Routers on a LAN.  The VRRP Router controlling the\r\nIPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a Virtual Router is called\r\nthe Active Router, and it forwards packets routed to these IPv4 or\r\nIPv6 addresses.  Active Routers are configured with virtual IPv4 or\r\nIPv6 addresses, and Backup Routers infer the address family of the\r\nvirtual addresses being advertised based on the IP protocol version. \r\nWithin a VRRP Router, the Virtual Routers in each of the IPv4 and\r\nIPv6 address families are independent of one another and always\r\ntreated as separate Virtual Router instances. The election process\r\nprovides dynamic failover in the forwarding responsibility should the\r\nActive Router become unavailable.  For IPv4, the advantage gained\r\nfrom using VRRP is a higher-availability default path without\r\nrequiring configuration of dynamic routing or router discovery\r\nprotocols on every end-host.  For IPv6, the advantage gained from\r\nusing VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker switchover to Backup Routers than\r\ncan be obtained with standard IPv6 Neighbor Discovery mechanisms.","pub_date":"April 2024","keywords":[],"obsoletes":["RFC5798"],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9568","errata_url":null}
