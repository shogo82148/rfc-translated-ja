One such important\r\ntechnology is Web Linking (RFC 8288), which CoRE specifications use\r\nas the basis for a number of discovery protocols, such as the Link\r\nFormat (RFC 6690) in the Constrained Application Protocol's (CoAP's)\r\nresource discovery process (Section 7.2 of RFC 7252) and the Resource\r\nDirectory (RD) (RFC 9176). \r\n\r\nWeb Links can have target attributes, the names of which are not\r\ngenerally coordinated by the Web Linking specification (Section 2.2\r\nof RFC 8288). This document introduces an IANA registry for\r\ncoordinating names of target attributes when used in CoRE. It updates\r\nthe \"RD Parameters\" IANA registry created by RFC 9176 to coordinate\r\nwith this registry.","pub_date":"April 2024","keywords":["CoAP","Web Linking","Resource Discovery"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9423","errata_url":null}
