It aims to be an alternative to the vCard data format\r\nand to be unambiguous, extendable, and simple to process. In contrast\r\nto the JSON-based jCard format, it is not a direct mapping from the\r\nvCard data model and expands semantics where appropriate. Two\r\nadditional specifications define new vCard elements and how to\r\nconvert between JSContact and vCard.","pub_date":"May 2024","keywords":["JSON","addressbook","contacts","cards","VCARD"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9553","errata_url":null}
