While\r\ndefining general message formats as well as the interface and\r\noperations available at the KDC, this document supports different\r\napproaches and protocols for secure group communication. Therefore,\r\ndetails are delegated to separate application profiles of this\r\ndocument as specialized instances that target a particular group\r\ncommunication approach and define how communications in the group are\r\nprotected. Compliance requirements for such application profiles are\r\nalso specified.","pub_date":"September 2024","keywords":["Key Management","Access Control","Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)","Secure group communication"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9594","errata_url":null}
