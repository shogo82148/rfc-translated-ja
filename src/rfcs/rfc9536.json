Considering that an RDAP\r\nentity can be associated with any defined object class and other\r\nrelationships between RDAP object classes exist, a reverse search can\r\nbe applied to other use cases besides the classic domain-entity\r\nscenario.  This document describes an RDAP extension that allows\r\nservers to provide a reverse search feature based on the relationship\r\ndefined in RDAP between an object class for search and any related\r\nobject class.  The reverse search based on the domain-entity\r\nrelationship is treated as a particular case.","pub_date":"April 2024","keywords":["RDAP","Reverse search"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9536","errata_url":null}
