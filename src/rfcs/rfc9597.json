This functionality helps to facilitate applications\r\nthat wish to make use of CWT claims in encrypted COSE structures\r\nand\/or COSE structures featuring detached signatures, while having\r\nsome of those claims be available before decryption and\/or without\r\ninspecting the detached payload. Another use case is using CWT claims\r\nwith payloads that are not CWT Claims Sets, including payloads that\r\nare not CBOR at all.","pub_date":"June 2024","keywords":["COSE","JOSE"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9597","errata_url":null}
