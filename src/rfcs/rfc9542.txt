1.  Introduction

   Some IETF protocols use Ethernet or other communication frame formats
   and parameters related to IEEE 802 [IEEE802].  These include Media
   Access Control (MAC) addresses and protocol identifiers.  The IEEE
   Registration Authority [IEEE_RA] manages the assignment of
   identifiers used in IEEE 802 networks, in some cases assigning blocks
   of such identifiers whose sub-assignment is managed by the entity to
   which the block is assigned.  The IEEE RA also provides a number of
   tutorials concerning these parameters [IEEEtutorials].

   IANA has been assigned an Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) by
   the IEEE RA and an associated set of MAC addresses and other
   organizationally unique code points based on that OUI.  This document
   specifies IANA considerations for the assignment of code points under
   that IANA OUI, including MAC addresses and protocol identifiers, and
   provides some values for use in documentation.  As noted in [RFC2606]
   and [RFC5737], the use of designated code values reserved for
   documentation and examples reduces the likelihood of conflicts and
   confusion arising from such code points conflicting with code points
   assigned for some deployed use.  This document also discusses several
   other uses by the IETF of IEEE 802 code points, including IEEE 802
   Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) code points [RFC7319] and IEEE
   802 Link Local Discovery Protocol (LLDP) [IEEE802.1AB] Vendor-
   Specific TLV Sub-Types [RFC8520].  It also specifies Concise Binary
   Object Representation (CBOR) tags for MAC addresses and OUIs /
   Company Identifiers (CIDs).

   Descriptions herein of [IANA] policies and procedures are
   authoritative, but descriptions of IEEE registration policies,
   procedures, and standards are only informative; for authoritative
   IEEE information, consult the IEEE sources.

   [RFC8126] is incorporated herein except where there are contrary
   provisions in this document.  In this document, "IESG Ratification",
   specified in Section 5.1, refers to a combination of Expert Review
   and IESG Approval as those are defined in [RFC8126], where IESG
   Approval is required only if the Expert does not reject the request.
   It is NOT the same as just "IESG Approval" in [RFC8126].

1.1.  Notations Used in This Document

   This document uses hexadecimal notation.  Each octet (that is, 8-bit
   byte) is represented by two hexadecimal digits giving the value of
   the octet as an unsigned integer.  Successive octets are separated by
   a hyphen.  This document consistently uses IETF ("network") bit
   ordering although the physical order of bit transmission within an
   octet on an IEEE [IEEE.802.3_2012] link is from the lowest order bit
   to the highest order bit (i.e., the reverse of the IETF's ordering).

1.2.  The IEEE Registration Authority

   Originally the responsibility of the Xerox Corporation, the
   registration authority for Ethernet parameters since 1986 has been
   the IEEE Registration Authority, available on the Web at [IEEE_RA].

   The IEEE Registration Authority operates under the direction of the
   IEEE Standards Association (IEEE SA) Board of Governors, with
   oversight by the IEEE Registration Authority Committee (IEEE RAC).
   The IEEE RAC is a committee of the Board of Governors.

   Anyone may apply to that authority for parameter assignments.  The
   IEEE Registration Authority may impose fees or other requirements but
   commonly waives fees for applications from standards development
   organizations.  Lists of assignments and their holders are
   downloadable from the IEEE Registration Authority site.

1.3.  The IANA Organizationally Unique Identifier

   The Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) 00-00-5E has been
   assigned to IANA by the IEEE Registration Authority.

   There is no OUI value reserved at this time for documentation, but
   there are documentation code points under the IANA OUI specified
   below.

1.4.  CFM Code Points

   IEEE Std 802.1Q [IEEE.802.1Q_2014] allocates two blocks of 802
   Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) code points to the IETF, one for
   CFM OpCodes and one for CFM TLV Types.  For further information, see
   [RFC7319].  The IANA "Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) OAM IETF
   Parameters" registry has subregistries for these code points.  This
   document does not further discuss these blocks of code points.

2.  Ethernet Identifier Parameters

   This section includes information summarized from [IEEE802_OandA]
   that is being provided for context.  The definitive information,
   which prevails in case of any discrepancy, is in [IEEE802_OandA].

   Section 2.1 discusses 48-bit MAC identifiers, their relationship to
   OUIs and other prefixes, and assignment under the IANA OUI.
   Section 2.2 extends this to 64-bit identifiers.  Section 2.3
   discusses other IETF MAC identifier uses not under the IANA OUI.
   Section 2.4 specifies CBOR tags for MAC addresses and OUIs/CIDs.

      |  Historical Note: [RAC_OUI] is an expired Internet-Draft that
      |  provides additional historic information on [IEEE802]
      |  registries.

2.1.  48-Bit MAC Identifiers, OUIs, and Other Prefixes

   48-bit MAC "addresses" are the most commonly used Ethernet interface
   identifiers.  Those that are globally unique are also called EUI-48
   identifiers (Extended Unique Identifier 48).  An EUI-48 is structured
   into an initial prefix assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority
   and additional bits assigned by the prefix owner.  As of 2024, there
   are three lengths of prefixes assigned, as shown in the table below;
   however, some prefix bits can have special meaning, as shown in
   Figure 1.

        +=======================+======+=========================+
        | Prefix Length in Bits | Name | Owner Supplied Bits for |
        |                       |      | 48-bit MAC Addresses    |
        +=======================+======+=========================+
        |           24          | MA-L |            24           |
        +-----------------------+------+-------------------------+
        |           28          | MA-M |            20           |
        +-----------------------+------+-------------------------+
        |           36          | MA-S |            12           |
        +-----------------------+------+-------------------------+

                                 Table 1

   The bottom (least significant) four bits of the first octet of the
   6-octet 48-bit MAC have special meaning, as shown in Figure 1, and
   are referred to below as the M, X, Y, and Z bits.

         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       | .  .  .  .  Z  Y  X  M| .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .| octets 0+1
       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
       | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .| .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .| octets 2+3

       +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+

                   Figure 1: 48-Bit MAC Address Structure

   For global addresses, X = 0 and a MAC address begins with 3 octets or
   a larger initial prefix indicating the assignee of the block of MAC
   addresses.  This prefix is followed by a sequence of additional
   octets so as to add up to the total MAC address length.  For example,
   the IEEE assigns MAC Address Block Small (MA-S), where the first four
   and a half octets (36 bits) are assigned, giving the holder of the
   MA-S one and a half octets (12 bits) they can control in constructing
   48-bit MAC addresses; other prefix lengths are also available
   [IEEEtutorials].

   An AFN, a DNS RRTYPE, and a CBOR tag have been assigned for 48-bit
   MAC addresses, as discussed in Sections 2.4, 5.3, and 5.9.

   IEEE Std 802 describes assignment procedures and policies for
   identifiers related to IEEE 802 [IEEE802_OandA].  IEEE RA
   documentation on EUIs, OUIs, and CIDs is available at
   [IEEEtutorials].

2.1.1.  Special First Octet Bits

   There are bits within the initial octet of an IEEE MAC address that
   have special significance [IEEE802_OandA], as described as follows:

   M bit -  This bit is frequently referred to as the "group" or
      "multicast" bit.  If it is zero, the MAC address is unicast.  If
      it is a one, the address is groupcast (multicast or broadcast).
      This meaning is independent of the values of the X, Y, and Z bits.

   X bit -  This bit is also called the "universal/local" bit (formerly
      called the Local/Global bit).  If it is zero, the MAC address is a
      global address under the control of the owner of the IEEE-assigned
      prefix.  Previously, if it was a one, the MAC address was
      considered "local" and under the assignment and control of the
      local network operator (but see Section 2.3).  If it is a one and
      if the IEEE 802 Structured Local Address Plan (SLAP) is in effect,
      the nature of the MAC address is optionally determined by the Y
      and Z bits, as described below.

   Y&Z bits -  These two bits have no special meaning if the X bit is
      zero.  If the X bit is one and if the IEEE 802 Structured Local
      Address Plan (SLAP) is in effect, these two bits divide the
      formerly uniform "local" MAC address space into four quadrants as
      follows and further described below:

               +=======+=======+===========================+
               | Y bit | Z bit | Quadrant                  |
               +=======+=======+===========================+
               |   0   |   0   | Administratively Assigned |
               +-------+-------+---------------------------+
               |   0   |   1   | Extended Local            |
               +-------+-------+---------------------------+
               |   1   |   0   | Reserved                  |
               +-------+-------+---------------------------+
               |   1   |   1   | Standard Assigned         |
               +-------+-------+---------------------------+

                                  Table 2

   While a local network administrator can assign any addresses with the
   X bit a one, the optional SLAP characterizes the four quadrants of
   the "local" address space using the Y and Z bits as follows:

   Administratively Assigned -  MAC addresses in this quadrant are
      called Administratively Assigned Identifiers.  This is intended
      for arbitrary local assignment, such as random assignment;
      however, see Section 2.3.1.

   Extended Local -  MAC addresses in this quadrant are called Extended
      Local Identifiers.  These addresses are not actually "local" under
      SLAP.  They are available to the organization that has been
      assigned the CID (see Section 2.1.2) specifying the other 20 bits
      of the 24-bit prefix with X, Y, and Z bits having the values 1, 0,
      and 1, respectively.

   Reserved -  MAC addresses in this quadrant are reserved for future
      use under the SLAP.  Until such future use, they could be locally
      assigned as Administratively Assigned Identifiers are assigned,
      but there is a danger that future SLAP use would conflict with
      such local assignments.

   Standard Assigned -  MAC addresses in this quadrant are called
      Standard Assigned Identifiers (SAIs).  An SAI is assigned by a
      protocol specified in an IEEE 802 standard, for example,
      [IEEE802.1CQ] (but see the first NOTE below).

         NOTE: While the SLAP has MAC addresses assigned through a local
         protocol in the SAI quadrant and assigned by a protocol
         specified in an IEEE 802 standard, the SLAP is optional.  Local
         network administrators may use the IETF protocol provisions in
         [RFC8947] and [RFC8948], which support assignment of a MAC
         address in the local MAC address space using DHCPv6 [RFC8415]
         or other protocol methods.

   NOTE: There isn't any automated way to determine if or to what extent
   a local network is configured for and/or operating according to SLAP.

2.1.2.  OUIs and CIDs

   MA-L, MA-M, and MA-S MAC prefixes are assigned with the Local bit
   zero.  The assignee of an OUI is exclusively authorized to assign
   group MAC addresses by extending a modified version of the assigned
   OUI in which the M bit (see Figure 1) is set to 1 [IEEEtutorials].

   The Local bit is zero for globally unique EUI-48 identifiers assigned
   by the owner of a MAC-L or owner of a longer prefix.  If the Local
   bit is a one, the identifier has historically been a local identifier
   under the control of the local network administrator; however, there
   are now recommendations on optional management of the local address
   space, as discussed in Section 2.1.1.  If the Local bit is a one, the
   holder of an OUI has no special authority over MAC identifiers whose
   first 3 octets correspond to their OUI or the beginning of their
   longer prefix.

   A CID is a 24-bit Company Identifier.  It is assigned for
   organizations that need such an identifier that can be used in place
   of an OUI but do not need to assign subsidiary global MAC addresses.
   A CID has X and Z bits equal to 1 and its Y bit equal to 0 (see
   Figure 1).

   An AFN and a CBOR tag have been assigned for OUIs/CIDs, as discussed
   in Sections 2.4, 5.3, and 5.9.

2.1.3.  48-Bit MAC Assignments under the IANA OUI

   The OUI 00-00-5E has been assigned to IANA, as stated in Section 1.3
   above.  This includes 2**24 48-bit multicast identifiers from
   01-00-5E-00-00-00 to 01-00-5E-FF-FF-FF and 2**24 EUI-48 unicast
   identifiers from 00-00-5E-00-00-00 to 00-00-5E-FF-FF-FF.

   Of these identifiers, the sub-blocks reserved or thus far assigned
   are as follows:

   Unicast, all blocks of 2**8 addresses thus far:
      00-00-5E-00-00-00 through 00-00-5E-00-00-FF:  reserved and require
         IESG Ratification for assignment (see Section 5.1).

      00-00-5E-00-01-00 through 00-00-5E-00-01-FF:  assigned for the
         Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) [RFC5798].

      00-00-5E-00-02-00 through 00-00-5E-00-02-FF:  assigned for the
         IPv6 Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (IPv6 VRRP) [RFC5798].

      00-00-5E-00-52-00 through 00-00-5E-00-52-FF:  used for very small
         assignments.  As of 2024, 4 out of these 256 values have been
         assigned.  See [EthernetNum].

      00-00-5E-00-53-00 through 00-00-5E-00-53-FF:  assigned for use in
         documentation by this document.

      00-00-5E-90-01-00 through 00-00-5E-90-01-FF:  used for very small
         assignments that need parallel unicast and multicast MAC
         addresses.  As of 2024, 1 out of these 256 values has been
         assigned.  See [EthernetNum].

   Multicast:
      01-00-5E-00-00-00 through 01-00-5E-7F-FF-FF:  2**23 addresses
         assigned for IPv4 multicast [RFC1112].

      01-00-5E-80-00-00 through 01-00-5E-8F-FF-FF:  2**20 addresses
         assigned for MPLS multicast [RFC5332].

      01-00-5E-90-00-00 through 01-00-5E-90-00-FF:  2**8 addresses being
         used for very small assignments.  As of 2024, 4 out of these
         256 values have been assigned.  See [EthernetNum].

      01-00-5E-90-01-00 through 01-00-5E-90-01-FF:  used for very small
         assignments that need parallel unicast and multicast MAC
         addresses.  As of 2024, 1 out of these 256 values has been
         assigned.  See [EthernetNum].

      01-00-5E-90-10-00 through 01-00-5E-90-10-FF:  2**8 addresses
         assigned for use in documentation by this document.

   For more detailed and up-to-date information, see the "IANA OUI
   Ethernet Numbers" registry at [EthernetNum].

2.1.4.  48-Bit MAC Documentation Values

   The following values have been assigned for use in documentation:

   *  00-00-5E-00-53-00 through 00-00-5E-00-53-FF for unicast and

   *  01-00-5E-90-10-00 through 01-00-5E-90-10-FF for multicast.

2.1.5.  48-Bit IANA MAC Assignment Considerations

   48-bit assignments under the current or a future IANA OUI (see
   Section 5.6) must meet the following requirements:

   *  must be for standards purposes (either for an IETF Standard or
      other standard related to IETF work),

   *  must be for a power-of-two-sized block of identifiers starting at
      a boundary that is an equal or greater power of two, including the
      assignment of one (2**0) identifier,

   *  must not be used to evade the requirement for network interface
      vendors to obtain their own block of identifiers from the IEEE,
      and

   *  must be documented in an Internet-Draft or RFC.

   In addition, approval must be obtained as follows (see the procedure
   in Section 5.1):

   *  Small to medium assignments of a block of 1, 2, 4, ..., 32768,
      65536 (2**0, 2**1, 2**2, ..., 2**15, 2**16) EUI-48 identifiers
      require Expert Review (see Section 5.1).

   *  Large assignments of 131072 (2**17) or more EUI-48 identifiers
      require IESG Ratification (see Section 5.1).

2.2.  64-Bit MAC Identifiers

   IEEE also defines a system of 64-bit MAC identifiers, including
   EUI-64s.  EUI-64 identifiers are used as follows:

   *  In IEEE Std 1394 [IEEE1394] (also known as FireWire and i.Link)

   *  In IEEE Std 802.15.4 [IEEE802.15.4] (also known as Zigbee)

   *  In [InfiniBand]

   *  In a modified form to construct some IPv6 Interface Identifiers,
      as described in Section 2.2.1, although this use is now deprecated

   Adding a 5-octet (40-bit) extension to a 3-octet (24-bit) assignment,
   or a shorter extension to longer assigned prefixes [RAC_OUI] so as to
   total 64 bits, produces an EUI-64 identifier under that OUI or longer
   prefix.  As with EUI-48 identifiers, the first octet has the same
   special low-order bits.

   An AFN, a DNS RRTYPE, and CBOR tag have been assigned for 64-bit MAC
   addresses, as discussed in Sections 2.4, 5.3, and 5.9.

   The discussion below is almost entirely in terms of the "Modified"
   form of EUI-64 identifiers; however, anyone assigned such an
   identifier can also use the unmodified form as a MAC identifier on
   any link that uses such 64-bit identifiers for interfaces.

2.2.1.  IPv6 Use of Modified EUI-64 Identifiers

   The approach described below for constructing IPv6 Interface
   Identifiers is now deprecated, and the method specified in [RFC8064]
   is recommended.

   EUI-64 identifiers have been used to form the lower 64 bits of some
   IPv6 addresses (Section 2.5.1 and Appendix A of [RFC4291] and
   Appendix A of [RFC5214]).  When so used, the EUI-64 is modified by
   inverting the X (universal/local) bit to form an IETF "Modified
   EUI-64 identifier".  Below is an illustration of a Modified EUI-64
   unicast identifier under the IANA OUI, where aa-bb-cc-dd-ee is the
   extension.

      02-00-5E-aa-bb-cc-dd-ee

   The first octet is shown as 02 rather than 00 because, in Modified
   EUI-64 identifiers, the sense of the X bit is inverted compared with
   EUI-48 identifiers.  It is the globally unique values (universal
   scope) that have the 0x02 bit (also known as the X or universal/local
   bit) on in the first octet, while those with this bit off are
   typically locally assigned and out of scope for global assignment.

   The X (universal/local) bit was inverted to make it easier for
   network operators to type in local-scope identifiers.  Thus, such
   Modified EUI-64 identifiers as 1, 2, etc. (ignoring leading zeros)
   are local.  Without the modification, they would have to be
   02-00-00-00-00-00-00-01, 02-00-00-00-00-00-00-02, etc. to be local.

   As with 48-bit MAC identifiers, the M bit (0x01) on in the first
   octet indicates a group identifier (multicast or broadcast).

   When the first two octets of the extension of a Modified EUI-64
   identifier are FF-FE, the remainder of the extension is a 24-bit
   value, as assigned by the OUI owner for an EUI-48.  For example:

      02-00-5E-FF-FE-yy-yy-yy

   or

      03-00-5E-FF-FE-yy-yy-yy

   where yy-yy-yy is the portion (of an EUI-48 global unicast or
   multicast identifier) that is assigned by the OUI owner (IANA in this
   case).  Thus, any holder of one or more EUI-48 identifiers under the
   IANA OUI also has an equal number of Modified EUI-64 identifiers that
   can be formed by inserting FF-FE in the middle of their EUI-48
   identifiers and inverting the universal/local bit.

   In addition, certain Modified EUI-64 identifiers under the IANA OUI
   are reserved for holders of IPv4 addresses as follows:

      02-00-5E-FE-xx-xx-xx-xx

   where xx-xx-xx-xx is a 32-bit IPv4 address.  The owner of an IPv4
   address has both a unicast- and multicast-derived EUI-64 address.
   Modified EUI-64 identifiers from

      02-00-5E-FE-F0-00-00-00 to 02-00-5E-FE-FF-FF-FF-FF

   are effectively reserved pending the specification of IPv4 "Class E"
   addresses [RFC1112].  However, for Modified EUI-64 identifiers based
   on an IPv4 address, the universal/local bit should be set to
   correspond to whether the IPv4 address is local or global.  (Keep in
   mind that the sense of the Modified EUI-64 identifier universal/local
   bit is reversed from that in (unmodified) EUI-64 identifiers.)

2.2.2.  EUI-64 IANA Assignment Considerations

   The following table shows which Modified EUI-64 identifiers under the
   IANA OUI are reserved, assigned, or available as indicated.  As noted
   above, the corresponding MAC addresses can be determined by
   complementing the 02 bit in the first octet.  In all cases, the
   corresponding multicast 64-bit MAC addresses formed by complementing
   the 01 bit in the first octet have the same status as the modified
   64-bit unicast address blocks listed below.  These values are
   prefixed with 02-00-5E to form unicast modified EUI-64 addresses.

                    Table 3: IANA 64-bit MAC Addresses

   The reserved identifiers above require IESG Ratification (see
   Section 5.1) for assignment.  IANA EUI-64 identifier assignments
   under the IANA OUI must meet the following requirements:

   *  must be for standards purposes (either for an IETF Standard or
      other standard related to IETF work),

   *  must be for a power-of-two-sized block of identifiers starting at
      a boundary that is an equal or greater power of two, including the
      assignment of one (2**0) identifier,

   *  must not be used to evade the requirement for network interface
      vendors to obtain their own block of identifiers from the IEEE,
      and

   *  must be documented in an Internet-Draft or RFC.

   In addition, approval must be obtained as follows (see the procedure
   in Section 5.1):

   *  Small to medium assignments of a block of 1, 2, 4, ..., 134217728,
      268435456 (2**0, 2**1, 2**2, ..., 2**27, 2**28) EUI-64 identifiers
      require Expert Review (see Section 5.1).

   *  Large assignments of 536870912 (2**29) or more EUI-64 identifiers
      require IESG Ratification (see Section 5.1).

2.2.3.  EUI-64 Documentation Values

   The following blocks of unmodified 64-bit MAC addresses are for
   documentation use.  The IPv4-derived addresses are based on the IPv4
   documentation addresses [RFC5737], and the MAC-derived addresses are
   based on the EUI-48 documentation addresses above.

   Unicast values for documentation use:

      00-00-5E-EF-10-00-00-00 to 00-00-5E-EF-10-00-00-FF general

      00-00-5E-FE-C0-00-02-00 to 00-00-5E-FE-C0-00-02-FF and
      00-00-5E-FE-C6-33-64-00 to 00-00-5E-FE-C6-33-64-FF and
      00-00-5E-FE-CB-00-71-00 to 00-00-5E-FE-CB-00-71-FF IPv4 derived

      00-00-5E-FF-FE-00-53-00 to 00-00-5E-FF-FE-00-53-FF EUI-48 derived

      00-00-5E-FE-EA-C0-00-02 and 00-00-5E-FE-EA-C6-33-64 and
      00-00-5E-FE-EA-CB-00-71 IPv4 multicast derived from IPv4 unicast
      [RFC6034]

   Multicast values for documentation use:

      01-00-5E-EF-10-00-00-00 to 01-00-5E-EF-10-00-00-FF general

      01-00-5E-FE-C0-00-02-00 to 01-00-5E-FE-C0-00-02-FF and
      01-00-5E-FE-C6-33-64-00 to 01-00-5E-FE-C6-33-64-FF and
      01-00-5E-FE-CB-00-71-00 to 01-00-5E-FE-CB-00-71-FF IPv4 derived

      01-00-5E-FE-EA-C0-00-02 and 01-00-5E-FE-EA-C6-33-64 and
      01-00-5E-FE-EA-CB-00-71 IPv4 multicast derived from IPv4 unicast
      [RFC6034]

      01-00-5E-FF-FE-90-10-00 to 01-00-5E-FF-FE-90-10-FF EUI-48 derived

2.3.  Other 48-Bit MAC Identifiers Used by the IETF

   There are two other blocks of 48-bit MAC identifiers that are used by
   the IETF as described below.

2.3.1.  Identifiers with a '33-33' Prefix

   All 48-bit multicast MAC identifiers prefixed with "33-33" (that is,
   the 2**32 multicast MAC identifiers in the range from
   33-33-00-00-00-00 to 33-33-FF-FF-FF-FF) are used as specified in
   [RFC2464] for IPv6 multicast.  In all of these identifiers, the Group
   bit (the bottom bit of the first octet) is on, as is required to work
   properly with existing hardware as a multicast identifier.  They also
   have the Local bit on, but any Ethernet using standard IPv6 multicast
   should note that these addresses will be used for that purpose.
   These multicast MAC addresses fall into the Administratively Assigned
   SLAP quadrant (see Section 2.1.1).

      |  Historical Notes: It was the custom during IPv6 design to use
      |  "3" for unknown or example values, and 3333 Coyote Hill Road,
      |  Palo Alto, California is the address of PARC (Palo Alto
      |  Research Center), formerly "Xerox PARC."  Ethernet was
      |  originally specified by the Digital Equipment Corporation,
      |  Intel Corporation, and Xerox Corporation.  The pre-IEEE
      |  [IEEE.802.3_2012] Ethernet protocol has sometimes been known as
      |  "DIX" Ethernet from the first letters of the names of these
      |  companies.

2.3.2.  The CF Series

   The Informational [RFC2153] declared the 3-octet values from CF-00-00
   through CF-FF-FF to be "OUIs" available for assignment by IANA to
   software vendors for use in PPP [RFC1661] or for other uses where
   vendors do not otherwise need an IEEE-assigned OUI.  When used as
   48-bit MAC prefixes, these values have all of the Z, Y, X (Local) and
   M (Group) special bits at the bottom of the first octet equal to one,
   while all IEEE-assigned OUIs thus far have the X and M bits as zero
   and all CIDs have the Y and M bits as zero; thus, there can be no
   conflict between CF series "OUIs" and IEEE-assigned OUIs/CIDs.
   Multicast MAC addresses constructed with a CF series OUI would fall
   into the Standard Assigned SLAP quadrant (see Section 2.1.1).  The
   Group bit is meaningless in PPP.  To quote [RFC2153]: "The 'CF0000'
   series was arbitrarily chosen to match the PPP NLPID 'CF', as a
   matter of mnemonic convenience."  (For further information on Network
   Layer Protocol Identifiers (NLPIDs), see [RFC6328].)

      CF-00-00 is reserved.  CF-00-00-00-00-00 is a multicast identifier
      listed by IANA as used for Ethernet loopback tests.

   In over a decade of availability, only a handful of values in the CF
   series have been assigned.  (See the "IANA OUI Ethernet Numbers"
   [EthernetNum] and "Point-to-Point (PPP) Protocol Field Assignments"
   [PPPNum] registry groups.)

2.3.2.1.  Changes to RFC 2153

   The IANA Considerations in [RFC2153] were updated as follows by the
   approval of [RFC5342] and remain so updated (no technical changes
   have been made):

   *  Use of these CF series identifiers based on IANA assignment was
      deprecated.

   *  IANA was instructed not to assign any further values in the CF
      series.

2.4.  CBOR Tags

   The Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC8949] is a data
   format whose design goals include the possibility of very small code
   size, fairly small message size, and extensibility.  In CBOR, a data
   item can be enclosed by a CBOR tag to give it some additional
   semantics identified by that tag.  CBOR-tagged data items (fields)
   are not used in actual IEEE 802 address fields but may be used in
   CBOR-encoded parts of protocol messages.

   IANA has assigned 48 as the CBOR tag to indicate a MAC address.  The
   enclosed data item is an octet string.  The length of the octet
   string indicates whether a 48-bit (6 octet) or 64-bit (8 octet) MAC
   address is encoded.  Should some other multiple of 8 bits be used in
   the future for the length of MAC addresses, such as a 128-bit
   (16-octet) MAC address, the 48 tag will be used.

   IANA has assigned 1048 as the CBOR tag to indicate an OUI, CID, or CF
   series organizational identifier.  The enclosed data item is an octet
   string of length 3 to hold the 24-bit OUI or CID (see Section 2.1.2).

3.  Ethernet Protocol Parameters

   Ethernet protocol parameters provide a means of indicating, near the
   beginning of a frame, the contents of that frame -- for example, that
   it contains IPv4 or IPv6.

   There are two types of protocol identifier parameters (see
   [EthernetNum]) that can occur in Ethernet frames:

   EtherTypes:
      These are 16-bit identifiers that, when considered as an unsigned
      integer, are equal to or larger than 0x0600.  Figure 2 shows the
      simplest case where the EtherType of the protocol data in the
      frame appears immediately after the destination and source MAC
      addresses.  [IEEE802_OandA] specifies two EtherTypes for local,
      experimental use: 0x88B5 and 0x88B6.

   LSAPs:
      These are 8-bit protocol identifiers that occur in pairs after a
      field that gives the frame length.  Such a length must, when
      considered as an unsigned integer, be less than 0x5DD, or it could
      be mistaken as an EtherType.  However, the LLC encapsulation
      EtherType 0x8870 [IEEE802.1AC] may also be used in place of such a
      length as a "length indication" of nonspecific length.  LSAPs
      occur in pairs, where one is intended to indicate the source
      protocol handler (SSAP) and the other the destination protocol
      handler (DSAP); however, use cases where the two are different
      have been relatively rare.  See Figure 3 for the simplest case
      where the length field appears immediately after the destination
      and source MAC addresses.  In that figure, the CTL (control) field
      value of 3 indicates datagram service.  This type of protocol
      identification is sometimes called "LLC" (Logical Link Control).

                   Figure 3: LSAP Frame Protocol Labeling

   The concept of EtherType labeling has been extended to labeling by
   Ethernet "tags".  An Ethernet tag in this sense is a prefix whose
   type is identified by an EtherType that is then followed by either
   another tag, an EtherType, or an LLC Link-Layer Service Access Point
   (LSAP) protocol indicator for the "main" body of the frame.
   Customarily, in the world of [IEEE802_OandA], tags are a fixed length
   and do not include any encoding of their own length.  An example is
   the C-Tag (formerly the Q-Tag) [IEEE.802.1Q_2014].  It provides
   customer VLAN and priority information for a frame.  Any device that
   is processing a frame cannot, in general, safely process anything in
   the frame past an EtherType it does not understand.

   Neither EtherTypes nor LSAPs are assigned by IANA; they are assigned
   by the IEEE Registration Authority [IEEE_RA] (see Section 1.2 and
   Appendix B).  However, both LSAPs and EtherTypes have extension
   mechanisms so that they can be used with five-octet Ethernet protocol
   identifiers under an OUI, including those assigned by IANA under the
   IANA OUI.

   When using the IEEE 802 Logical Link Control (LLC) format (Subnetwork
   Access Protocol (SNAP)) [IEEE802_OandA] for a frame, an OUI-based
   protocol identifier can be expressed as follows:

      xx-xx-AA-AA-03-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz

   where xx-xx is the frame length and, as above, must be small enough
   not to be confused with an EtherType; "AA" is the LSAP that indicates
   this use and is sometimes referred to as the SNAP Service Access
   Point (SNAP SAP); "03" is the LLC control octet indicating datagram
   service; yy-yy-yy is an OUI; and zz-zz is a protocol number, under
   that OUI, assigned by the OUI owner.  The five-octet length for such
   OUI-based protocol identifiers results, with the LLC control octet
   ("0x03"), in the preservation of 16-bit alignment.

   When using an EtherType to indicate the main type for a frame body,
   the special "OUI Extended EtherType" 0x88B7 is available.  Using this
   EtherType, a frame body can begin with

      88-B7-yy-yy-yy-zz-zz

   where yy-yy-yy and zz-zz have the same meaning as in the SNAP format
   described above; however, this format with EtherType 0x88B7 does not
   preserve 16-bit alignment.

   It is also possible, within the SNAP format, to use an arbitrary
   EtherType.  Putting the EtherType as the zz-zz field after an all-
   zeros OUI (00-00-00) does this.  It looks like

      xx-xx-AA-AA-03-00-00-00-zz-zz

   where zz-zz is the EtherType.

   As well as labeling frame contents, IEEE 802 protocol types appear
   within Non-Broadcast Multi-Access (NBMA) Next Hop Resolution Protocol
   [RFC2332] messages.  Such messages have provisions for both two-octet
   EtherTypes and OUI-based protocol types. 16-bit EtherTypes also occur
   in the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) [RFC2784] header and in
   the Generic Network Virtualization Encapsulation (Geneve) [RFC8926]
   encapsulation header.

3.1.  Ethernet Protocol Assignment under the IANA OUI

   Two-octet protocol numbers under the IANA OUI are available, as in

      88-B7-00-00-5E-qq-qq

   or

      xx-xx-AA-AA-03-00-00-5E-qq-qq

   where qq-qq is the protocol number.

   A number of such assignments have been made out of the 2**16 protocol
   numbers available from 00-00-5E-00-00 to 00-00-5E-FF-FF (see
   [EthernetNum]).  The extreme values of this range, 00-00-5E-00-00 and
   00-00-5E-FF-FF, are reserved and require IESG Ratification for
   assignment (see Section 5.1).  New assignments of protocol numbers
   (qq-qq) under the IANA OUI must meet the following requirements:

   *  the assignment must be for standards use (either for an IETF
      Standard or other standard related to IETF work),

   *  the protocol must include a version field at a fixed offset or an
      equivalent marking such that later versions can be indicated in a
      way recognizable by earlier versions,

   *  the protocol must be documented in an Internet-Draft or RFC, and

   *  such protocol numbers are not to be assigned for any protocol that
      has an EtherType.  (That EtherType can be used directly, or -- in
      the LSAPs case -- it can be used with the SNAP SAP by putting an
      all-zero "OUI" before the EtherType as described above.)

   In addition, the Expert Review (or IESG Ratification for the two
   reserved values) must be obtained using the procedure specified in
   Section 5.1.

3.2.  Documentation Protocol Number

   0x0042 is a protocol number under the IANA OUI (that is,
   00-00-5E-00-42) to be used as an example for documentation purposes.

4.  Other OUI/CID-Based Parameters

   Some IEEE 802 and other protocols provide for parameters based on an
   OUI or CID beyond those discussed above.  Such parameters commonly
   consist of an OUI or CID plus one octet of additional value.  They
   are called Organizationally Specific parameters (sometimes informally
   and less accurately referred to as "vendor specific").  They would
   look like

      yy-yy-yy-zz

   where yy-yy-yy is the OUI/CID and zz is the additional specifier.  An
   example is the Cipher Suite Selector in [IEEE.802.11_2012].

   Values may be assigned under the IANA OUI for other OUI-based
   parameter usage by Expert Review, except that, for each use, the
   additional specifier values consisting of all zero bits and all one
   bits (0x00 (00-00-5E-00) and 0xFF (00-00-5E-FF) for a one-octet
   specifier) are reserved and require IESG Ratification (see
   Section 5.1) for assignment; also, the additional specifier value
   0x42 (00-00-5E-42 for a one octet specifier, right justified and
   filled with zeros on the left if the specifier is more than one
   octet) is assigned for use as an example in documentation.

   Assignments of other IANA OUI-based parameters must be for standards
   use (either for an IETF Standard or other standard related to IETF
   work) and be documented in an Internet-Draft or RFC.  The first time
   a value is assigned for a particular parameter of this type, an IANA
   registry will be created to contain that assignment and any
   subsequent assignments of values for that parameter under the IANA
   OUI.  The Expert may specify the name of the registry.

   If different policies from those above are required for such a
   parameter, a BCP or Standards Track RFC should be adopted to update
   this BCP and specify the new policy and parameter.

4.1.  LLDP IETF Organizationally Specific TLV Type

   An example of an "other IANA OUI-based parameter" is specified in
   [RFC8520].  This provides for an Organizationally Specific TLV type
   for announcing a Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) Uniform
   Resource Locator (URL) in the IEEE Link Local Discovery Protocol
   (LLDP) [IEEE802.1AB].  Additional IETF use of code points in this
   space have been proposed [BGP11dp].  (See also Section 5.8.)

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document concerns IANA considerations for the assignment of
   Ethernet parameters in connection with the IANA OUI and related
   matters.

      Note: The "IANA OUI Ethernet Numbers" registry group (web page) is
      for registries of numbers assigned under the IANA OUI, while the
      "IEEE 802 Numbers" registry group has informational lists of
      numbers assigned by the IEEE Registration Authority.

   This document does not create any new IANA registries.

   The MAC address values assigned for documentation and the protocol
   number for documentation were both assigned by [RFC7042].

   No existing assignment is changed by this document.

5.1.  Expert Review and IESG Ratification

   This section specifies the procedures for Expert Review and IESG
   Ratification of MAC, protocol, and other IANA OUI-based identifiers.
   The Expert(s) referred to in this document shall consist of one or
   more persons appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the IESG.

5.1.1.  Expert Review Guidance

   The procedure described for Expert Review assignments in this
   document is consistent with the IANA Expert Review policy described
   in [RFC8126].

   While finite, the universe of MAC code points from which Expert-
   judged assignments will be made is considered to be large enough that
   the requirements given in this document and the Experts' good
   judgment are sufficient guidance.  The idea is for the Expert to
   provide a light reasonableness check for small assignments of MAC
   identifiers, with increased scrutiny by the Expert for medium-sized
   assignments of MAC identifiers and assignments of protocol
   identifiers and other IANA OUI-based parameters.

5.1.2.  Expert Review and IESG Ratification Procedure

   It can make sense to assign very large portions of the MAC identifier
   code point space.  (Note that existing assignments include one for
   half of the entire multicast IANA 48-bit code point space and one for
   a sixteenth of that multicast code point space.)  In those cases, and
   in cases of the assignment of "reserved" values, IESG Ratification of
   an Expert Review approval recommendation is required as described
   below.  This can be viewed as a combination of Expert Review and IESG
   Approval as defined in [RFC8126].  IESG Approval is required only
   when the Expert does not reject the request.  The procedure is as
   follows:

      The applicant always completes the appropriate template from
      Appendix A below and sends it to IANA <iana@iana.org>.

      IANA always sends the template to an appointed Expert.  If the
      Expert recuses themselves or is non-responsive, IANA may choose an
      alternative appointed Expert or, if none is available, will
      contact the IESG.

      In all cases, if IANA receives a disapproval from an Expert
      selected to review an application template, the application will
      be denied.  The Expert should provide a reason for refusal, which
      IANA will communicate back to the applicant.

      If the assignment is based on Expert Review:

         If IANA receives approval and code points are available, IANA
         will make the requested assignment.

      If the assignment is based on IESG Ratification:

         The procedure starts with the first steps above for Expert
         Review.  If the Expert disapproves the application, they simply
         inform IANA, who in turn informs the applicant that their
         request is denied; however, if the Expert believes the
         application should be approved or is uncertain and believes
         that the circumstances warrant the attention of the IESG, the
         Expert will inform IANA about their advice, and IANA will
         forward the application, together with the reasons provided by
         the Expert for approval or uncertainty, to the IESG.  The IESG
         must decide whether the assignment will be granted.  This can
         be accomplished by a management item in an IESG telechat, as is
         done for other types of requests.  If the IESG decides not to
         ratify a favorable opinion by the Expert or decides against an
         application where the Expert is uncertain, the application is
         denied; otherwise, it is granted.  The IESG will communicate
         its decision to the Expert and to IANA.  In case of refusal,
         the IESG should provide a reason, which IANA will communicate
         to the applicant.

5.2.  IANA Registry Group (Web Page) Name Changes

   For clarity and parallelism with the IANA "IEEE 802 Numbers" registry
   group, the IANA "Ethernet Numbers" registry group has been renamed
   the "IANA OUI Ethernet Numbers" registry.

   As this document replaces [RFC7042], references to [RFC7042] in IANA
   registries in both the "IEEE 802 Numbers" and the "IANA OUI Ethernet
   Numbers" registry groups have been replaced by references to this
   document.  Other IANA registry references to [RFC7042] are not
   changed.

5.3.  MAC Address AFNs and RRTYPEs

   IANA has assigned Address Family Numbers (AFNs) for MAC addresses as
   follows:

               +============+=========+========+===========+
               | AFN        | Decimal | Hex    | Reference |
               +============+=========+========+===========+
               | 48-bit MAC | 16389   | 0x4005 | [RFC7042] |
               +------------+---------+--------+-----------+
               | 64-bit MAC | 16390   | 0x4006 | [RFC7042] |
               +------------+---------+--------+-----------+
               | OUI        | 16391   | 0x4007 | [RFC7961] |
               +============+=========+========+===========+
               | Lower 24 bits of a 48-bit MAC address:    |
               +============+=========+========+===========+
               | MAC/24     | 16392   | 0x4008 | [RFC7961] |
               +============+=========+========+===========+
               | Lower 40 bits of a 64-bit MAC address:    |
               +============+=========+========+===========+
               | MAC/40     | 16393   | 0x4009 | [RFC7961] |
               +------------+---------+--------+-----------+

                                  Table 4

   IANA has assigned DNS RRTYPEs [RFC6895] for MAC addresses as follows:

         +============+==========+==================+===========+
         |            |          |   RRTYPE Code    |           |
         +============+==========+=========+========+===========+
         | Data       | Mnemonic | Decimal | Hex    | Reference |
         +============+==========+=========+========+===========+
         | 48-bit MAC |  EUI48   |   108   | 0x006C | [RFC7043] |
         +------------+----------+---------+--------+-----------+
         | 64-bit MAC |  EUI64   |   109   | 0x006D | [RFC7043] |
         +------------+----------+---------+--------+-----------+

                                 Table 5

5.4.  Informational IANA Registry Group Material

   IANA maintains an informational registry group, currently implemented
   as a web page, concerning EtherTypes, OUIs, and multicast addresses
   assigned under OUIs other than the IANA OUI.  The title of this
   informational registry group is "IEEE 802 Numbers".  IANA updates
   that informational registry group when changes are provided by or
   approved by the Expert(s).

5.5.  EtherType Assignment Process

   Applying to the IEEE Registration Authority for an EtherType needed
   by an IETF protocol requires IESG Approval, as stated in Appendix B.
   To minimize confusion, this process will normally be done by the
   primary expert for the informational "EtherType" registry within the
   "IEEE 802 Numbers" registry group, as described below (see also
   Section 5.4).

   After IESG Approval of the requirement for an EtherType, the IESG
   should refer the matter to IANA.  In any case, IANA will ask the
   "EtherType" registry expert to execute the IEEE Registration
   Authority [IEEE_RA] EtherType request process.  This path is
   specified because the IESG usually deals with IANA for assignment
   actions and because IANA should be aware of which "EtherType"
   registry expert(s) are available, normally referring the making of
   the EtherType assignment request to the primary expert.

   Here is sample text for an Internet-Draft where both IANA and IEEE
   assignments are required, where "YYY" would be replaced by an
   explanation of for what/why the EtherType is needed in whatever level
   of detail is necessary and would normally include a reference or
   references to other appropriate parts of the Internet-Draft:

   |  X.  Assignment Considerations
   |  
   |  X.1.  IEEE Assignment Considerations
   |  
   |     The IESG is requested to approve applying to the IEEE
   |     Registration Authority for an EtherType for YYY.  (The IESG
   |     should communicate its approval to IANA and to those concerned
   |     with this document.  IANA will forward the IESG Approval to the
   |     registry expert of the "EtherType" registry from the "IEEE 802
   |     Numbers" registry group who will make the application to the
   |     IEEE Registration Authority, keeping IANA informed.)
   |  
   |  X.2.  IANA Considerations
   |  
   |     ...

5.6.  OUI Exhaustion

   When the available space for either multicast or unicast EUI-48
   identifiers under OUI 00-00-5E has been 90% or more exhausted, IANA
   should request an additional OUI from the IEEE Registration Authority
   for further IANA assignment.  The appointed Expert(s) should monitor
   for this condition and notify IANA.

5.7.  IANA OUI MAC Address Table

   The following changes are made by this document to the Notes for the
   "IANA Unicast 48-bit MAC Addresses", the "IANA Multicast 48-bit MAC
   Addresses", and the "IANA 64-bit MAC Addresses" registries.  In
   addition, the references in those registries are updated, as
   specified in Section 5.2.

   The Notes for the "IANA Unicast 48-bit MAC Addresses" registry and
   for the "IANA Multicast 48-bit MAC Addresses" registry are changed to
   the following:

   |  These values are prefixed with 00-00-5E.  See Section 2.1.3 of RFC
   |  9542.

   The Note for the "IANA 64-bit MAC Addresses" registry is changed to
   the following:

   |  These values are prefixed with 00-00-5E to form unicast MAC
   |  addresses, with 01-00-5E to form multicast MAC addresses, with
   |  02-00-5E to form unicast modified EUI-64 addresses, and with
   |  03-00-5E to form multicast modified EUI-64 addresses.  See RFC
   |  9542, particularly Section 2.2.2, for more details.

5.8.  IANA LLDP TLV Subtypes

   IANA has moved the "IANA Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) TLV
   Subtypes" registry from the "IEEE 802 Numbers" registry group to the
   "IANA OUI Ethernet Numbers" registry group, since code points within
   it are assigned by IANA, and has added RFC 9542 as an additional
   reference for that registry.

   In addition, IANA has updated three entries in that registry as
   follows:

         +=======+==================================+===========+
         | Value | Description                      | Reference |
         +=======+==================================+===========+
         |     0 | Reserved                         | RFC 9542  |
         +-------+----------------------------------+-----------+
         |    42 | Example for use in documentation | RFC 9542  |
         +-------+----------------------------------+-----------+
         |   255 | Reserved                         | RFC 9542  |
         +-------+----------------------------------+-----------+

                                 Table 6

   The entries for 1 (MUD), 2-41 (unassigned), and 43-254 (unassigned)
   are unchanged.

5.9.  CBOR Tag Assignments

   IANA has assigned two CBOR Tags as shown below in the "Concise Binary
   Object Representation (CBOR) Tags" registry.

           +======+=============+==================+===========+
           | Tag  | Data Item   | Semantics        | Reference |
           +======+=============+==================+===========+
           | 48   | byte string | IEEE MAC Address | RFC 9542  |
           +------+-------------+------------------+-----------+
           | 1048 | byte string | IEEE OUI/CID     | RFC 9542  |
           +------+-------------+------------------+-----------+

                                  Table 7

6.  Security Considerations

   This document is concerned with assignment of IEEE 802 parameters
   allocated to IANA, particularly those under the IANA OUI, and closely
   related matters.  It is not directly concerned with security except
   as follows:

      Confusion and conflict can be caused by the use of MAC addresses
      or other OUI-derived protocol parameters as examples in
      documentation.  Examples that are "only" to be used in
      documentation can end up being coded and released or cause
      conflicts due to later real use and the possible acquisition of
      intellectual property rights in such addresses or parameters.  The
      reservation herein of MAC addresses and parameters for
      documentation purposes will minimize such confusion and conflict.

   MAC addresses are identifiers provided by a device to the network.
   On certain devices, MAC addresses are not static and can be
   configured.  The network should exercise caution when using these
   addresses to enforce policy because addresses can be spoofed and
   previously seen devices can return to the network with a new address.

   MAC addresses identify a physical or virtual interface and can be
   used for tracking the device with that interface.  Thus, they can be
   used to track users associated with that device.  See [madinas] for
   related privacy considerations and a discussion of MAC address
   randomization to partially mitigate this threat.  Also, see [RFC7043]
   for the security and privacy considerations of publishing MAC
   addresses in DNS.

Appendix A.  Templates

   This appendix provides the specific templates for IANA assignments of
   parameters.  Explanatory words in parentheses in the templates below
   may be deleted in a completed template as submitted to IANA.

A.1.  EUI-48/EUI-64 Identifier or Identifier Block Template

   Applicant Name:

   Applicant Email:

   Applicant Telephone: (starting with the country code)

   Use Name: (brief name of Parameter use, such as "Foo Protocol"
   [RFC3092])

   Document: (I-D or RFC specifying use to which the identifier or block
   of identifiers will be put)

   Specify whether this is an application for EUI-48 or EUI-64
   identifiers:

   Size of Block requested: (must be a power-of-two-sized block, can be
   a block of size one (2**0))

   Specify multicast, unicast, or both:

A.2.  IANA OUI/CID-Based Protocol Number Template

   Applicant Name:

   Applicant Email:

   Applicant Telephone: (starting with the country code)

   Use Name: (brief name of use of code point, such as "Foo Protocol")

   Document: (I-D or RFC specifying use to which the protocol identifier
   will be put)

   Note: (any additional note)

A.3.  Other IANA OUI/CID-Based Parameter Template

   Applicant Name:

   Applicant Email:

   Applicant Telephone: (starting with the country code)

   Protocol where the OUI/CID-Based Parameter for which a value is being
   requested appears: (such as Cipher Suite selection in IEEE 802.11)

   Use Name: (brief name of use of code point to be assigned, such as
   "Foo Cipher Suite" [RFC3092])

   Document: (I-D or RFC specifying use to which the other IANA OUI-
   based parameter value will be put)

   Note: (any additional note)

Appendix B.  EtherTypes

   This appendix provides a copy of the IESG Statement issued in May
   2023 on obtaining new IETF EtherTypes in Appendix B.1.  Note that
   there is an informational IANA registry of some important EtherTypes
   specified for IETF protocols or by IEEE 802 available, currently at
   [IANA].  The IEEE Registration Authority page on EtherTypes
   <https://standards.ieee.org/regauth/ethertype/eth.txt> may also be
   useful.  See Section 3 above.

B.1.  IESG Statement on EtherTypes

   From:  IESG
   Date:  1 May 2023

   The IEEE Registration Authority (IEEE RA) assigns EtherTypes with
   oversight from the IEEE Registration Authority Committee (IEEE RAC).

   (See https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/regauth/
   ethertype/.) Some IETF protocol specifications make use of
   EtherTypes.  All EtherType applications are subject to IEEE RA
   technical review for consistency with policy.

   Since EtherTypes are a fairly scarce resource, the IEEE RAC has let
   us know that they will not assign a new EtherType to a new IETF
   protocol specification until the IESG has approved the protocol
   specification for publication as an RFC.  In exceptional cases, the
   IEEE RA is willing to consider "early allocation" of an EtherType for
   an IETF protocol that is still under development as long as the
   request comes from and has been vetted by the IESG.

   To let the IEEE RAC know that the IESG has approved the request for
   an Ethernet assignment for an IETF protocol, all future requests for
   assignment of EtherTypes for IETF protocols will be made by the IESG.

   Note that Local Experimental ("playpen") EtherTypes have been
   assigned in IEEE 802 [1] use during protocol development and
   experimentation.

   Networks: Overview and Architecture.

Appendix C.  Changes from RFC 7042

   This document obsoletes [RFC7042] and makes the changes listed below.
   However, the completed application template based upon which an IANA
   OUI-based protocol number value was assigned for document use remains
   that in Appendix C of [RFC7042].

   *  Add information on MA-M (28-bit) and MA-S (36-bit) EUI prefixes
      that the IEEE Registration Authority assigns.

   *  Add information on the restructuring of the "local" MAC address
      space into four quadrants under the Structured Local Address Plan
      (SLAP) [IEEE802_OandA].

   *  Include the IESG Statement on EtherTypes (see Appendix B.1) and
      more detailed IETF procedures for applying to the IEEE
      Registration Authority for an EtherType for use in an IETF
      protocol (see Section 5.5).

   *  Mention that IEEE 802 CFM code points have been allocated to the
      IETF (see Section 1.4).

   *  Mention the Organizationally Specific LLDP data element that has
      been assigned under the IANA OUI and the registry set up for
      future such assignments (see Section 4.1).

   *  Clarify minor details in Section 5.1 on Expert Review and IESG
      Ratification.

   *  Specify CBOR tags for MAC addresses and OUIs/CIDs (see
      Section 2.4).

   *  Add a version field requirement for the allocation of protocol
      numbers under the IANA OUI (see Section 3.1).

   *  Mention that EtherTypes are used in the Geneve [RFC8926]
      encapsulation header (see Section 3).

   *  Add "a combination of Expert Review and IESG Approval" as part of
      the specification for "IESG Ratification".
