This update to RFC 3849 expands on\r\nthe existing 2001:db8::\/32 address block with the reservation of an\r\nadditional, larger prefix.  The addition of a \/20 prefix allows\r\ndocumented examples to more closely reflect a broader range of\r\nrealistic, current deployment scenarios and more closely aligns with\r\ncontemporary allocation models for large networks.","pub_date":"August 2024","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":["RFC3849"],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9637","errata_url":null}
