GNS is a decentralized and censorship-resistant domain\r\nname resolution protocol that provides a privacy-enhancing\r\nalternative to the Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. \r\n\r\nThis document defines the normative wire format of resource records,\r\nresolution processes, cryptographic routines, and security and\r\nprivacy considerations for use by implementers. \r\n\r\nThis specification was developed outside the IETF and does not have\r\nIETF consensus.  It is published here to inform readers about the\r\nfunction of GNS, guide future GNS implementations, and ensure\r\ninteroperability among implementations (for example, pre-existing\r\nGNUnet implementations).","pub_date":"November 2023","keywords":["name systems"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9498","errata_url":null}
