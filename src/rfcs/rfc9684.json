Complementary measurement logs\r\noriginating from one or more Roots of Trust for Measurement (RTMs)\r\nare also provided by the YANG RPCs.  The defined module requires the\r\ninclusion of the following in the device components of the composite\r\ndevice on which the YANG server is running: at least one Trusted\r\nPlatform Module (TPM) of either version 1.2 or 2.0 as well as a\r\ncorresponding TPM Software Stack (TSS), or an equivalent hardware\r\nimplementation that includes the protected capabilities as provided\r\nby TPMs as well as a corresponding software stack.","pub_date":"December 2024","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9684","errata_url":null}
