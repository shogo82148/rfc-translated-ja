1.  Introduction

   This document defines a data model for the Babel routing protocol
   [RFC8966].  The data model is defined using YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] and is
   compatible with Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA)
   [RFC8342].  It is based on the Babel information model [RFC9046].
   The data model only includes data nodes that are useful for managing
   Babel over IPv6.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Tree Diagram Annotations

   For a reference to the annotations used in tree diagrams included in
   this document, please see "YANG Tree Diagrams" [RFC8340].

2.  Babel Module

   This document defines a YANG 1.1 [RFC7950] data model for the
   configuration and management of Babel.  The YANG module is based on
   the Babel information model [RFC9046].

2.1.  Information Model

   It's worth noting a few differences between the Babel information
   model and this data module.  The information model mandates the
   definition of some of the attributes, e.g., "babel-implementation-
   version" or the "babel-self-router-id".  These attributes are marked
   as read-only objects in the information module as well as in this
   data module.  However, there is no way in the data module to mandate
   that a read-only attribute be present.  It is up to the
   implementation of this data module to make sure that the attributes
   that are marked "read only" and are mandatory are indeed present.

2.2.  Tree Diagram

   The following diagram illustrates a top-level hierarchy of the model.
   In addition to the version implemented by this device, the model
   contains subtrees on "constants", "interfaces", "mac-key-set",
   "dtls", and "routes".

   module: ietf-babel

     augment /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols
               /rt:control-plane-protocol:
       +--rw babel!
          +--ro version?              string
          +--rw enable                boolean
          +--ro router-id?            binary
          +--ro seqno?                uint16
          +--rw statistics-enabled?   boolean
          +--rw constants
          |     ...
          +--rw interfaces* [reference]
          |     ...
          +--rw mac-key-set* [name]
          |     ...
          +--rw dtls* [name]
          |     ...
          +--ro routes* [prefix]
                ...

   The "interfaces" subtree describes attributes such as the "interface"
   object that is being referenced; the type of link, e.g., wired,
   wireless, or tunnel, as enumerated by "metric-algorithm" and "split-
   horizon"; and whether the interface is enabled or not.

   The "constants" subtree describes the UDP port used for sending and
   receiving Babel messages and the multicast group used to send and
   receive announcements on IPv6.

   The "routes" subtree describes objects such as the prefix for which
   the route is advertised, a reference to the neighboring route, and
   the "next-hop" address.

   Finally, for security, two subtrees are defined to contain Message
   Authentication Code (MAC) keys and DTLS certificates.  The "mac-key-
   set" subtree contains keys used with the MAC security mechanism.  The
   boolean flag "default-apply" indicates whether the set of MAC keys is
   automatically applied to new interfaces.  The "dtls" subtree contains
   certificates used with the DTLS security mechanism.  Similar to the
   MAC mechanism, the boolean flag "default-apply" indicates whether the
   set of DTLS certificates is automatically applied to new interfaces.

2.3.  YANG Module

   This YANG module augments the YANG routing management module
   [RFC8349] to provide a common framework for all routing subsystems.
   By augmenting the module, it provides a common building block for
   routes and Routing Information Bases (RIBs).  It also has a reference
   to an interface defined by "A YANG Data Model for Interface
   Management" [RFC8343].

   A router running the Babel routing protocol can sometimes determine
   the parameters it needs to use for an interface based on the
   interface name.  For example, it can detect that eth0 is a wired
   interface and that wlan0 is a wireless interface.  This is not true
   for a tunnel interface, where the link parameters need to be
   configured explicitly.

   For a wired interface, it will assume "two-out-of-three" is set for
   "metric-algorithm" and "split-horizon" is set to true.  On the other
   hand, for a wireless interface, it will assume "etx" is set for
   "metric-algorithm" and "split-horizon" is set to false.  However, if
   the wired link is connected to a wireless radio, the values can be
   overridden by setting "metric-algorithm" to "etx" and "split-horizon"
   to false.  Similarly, an interface that is a metered 3G link and is
   used for fallback connectivity needs much higher default time
   constants, e.g., "mcast-hello-interval" and "update-interval", in
   order to avoid carrying control traffic as much as possible.

   In addition to the modules used above, this module imports
   definitions from "Common YANG Data Types" [RFC6991] and references
   "HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication" [RFC2104], "Using
   HMAC-SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-384, and HMAC-SHA-512 with IPsec" [RFC4868],
   "Textual Encodings of PKIX, PKCS, and CMS Structures" [RFC7468], "The
   BLAKE2 Cryptographic Hash and Message Authentication Code (MAC)"
   [RFC7693], "Network Configuration Access Control Model" [RFC8341],
   "The Babel Routing Protocol" [RFC8966], "MAC Authentication for the
   Babel Routing Protocol" [RFC8967], "Babel Information Model"
   [RFC9046], "The Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) Protocol
   Version 1.3" [RFC9147], and "YANG Data Types and Groupings for
   Cryptography" [RFC9640].

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  URI Registration

   IANA has registered the following URI in the "ns" registry of the
   "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].

   URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-babel
   Registrant Contact:  The IESG
   XML:  N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

3.2.  YANG Module Name Registration

   IANA has registered the following in the "YANG Module Names" registry
   [RFC6020].

   Name:  ietf-babel
   Namespace:  urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-babel
   Prefix:  babel
   Reference:  RFC 9647

4.  Security Considerations

   This section is modeled after the template defined in Section 3.7.1
   of [RFC8407].

   The "ietf-babel" YANG module defines a data model that is designed to
   be accessed via YANG-based management protocols, such as NETCONF
   [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  These protocols have mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport layers (e.g., Secure Shell (SSH)
   [RFC4252], TLS [RFC8446], and QUIC [RFC9000]) and mandatory-to-
   implement mutual authentication.

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF users to
   a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operations
   and content.

   The security considerations outlined here are specific to the YANG
   data model and do not cover security considerations of the Babel
   protocol or its security mechanisms in "The Babel Routing Protocol"
   [RFC8966], "MAC Authentication for the Babel Routing Protocol"
   [RFC8967], and "Babel Routing Protocol over Datagram Transport Layer
   Security" [RFC8968].  Each of these has its own Security
   Considerations section for considerations that are specific to it.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module that are
   writable/created/deleted (i.e., config true, which is the default).
   These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>) to
   these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative effect
   on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and
   their sensitivity/vulnerability from a config true perspective:

   'babel':  This container includes an 'enable' parameter that can be
      used to enable or disable use of Babel on a router.

   'babel/constants':  This container includes configuration parameters
      that can prevent reachability if misconfigured.

   'babel/interfaces':  This leaf-list has configuration parameters that
      can enable/disable security mechanisms and change performance
      characteristics of the Babel protocol.  For example, enabling
      logging of packets and giving unintended access to the log files
      gives an attacker detailed knowledge of the network and allows it
      to launch an attack on the traffic traversing the network device.

   'babel/hmac' and 'babel/dtls':  These contain security credentials
      that influence whether incoming packets are trusted and whether
      outgoing packets are produced in such a way that the receiver will
      treat them as trusted.

   Some of the readable data or config false nodes in this YANG module
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  It is thus important to control read access (e.g., via
   get, get-config, or notification) to these data nodes.  These are the
   subtrees and data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability from a
   config false perspective:

   'babel':  Access to the information in the various nodes can disclose
      the network topology.  Additionally, the routes used by a network
      device may be used to mount a subsequent attack on traffic
      traversing the network device.

   'babel/hmac' and 'babel/dtls':  These contain security credentials,
      including private credentials of the router; however, it is
      required that these values not be readable.

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability from an RPC operation
   perspective:

   This model defines two actions.  Resetting the statistics within an
   interface container would be visible to any monitoring processes,
   which should be designed to account for the possibility of such a
   reset.  The "test" action allows for validation that a MAC key and
   MAC algorithm have been properly configured.  The MAC key is a
   sensitive piece of information, and it is important to prevent an
   attacker that does not know the MAC key from being able to determine
   the MAC value by trying different input parameters.  The "test"
   action has been designed to not reveal such information directly.
   Such information might also be revealed indirectly due to side
   channels such as the time it takes to produce a response to the
   action.  Implementations SHOULD use a constant-time comparison
   between the input MAC and the locally generated MAC value for
   comparison in order to avoid such side channel leakage.

A.2.  Statistics Gathering Enabled

   In this example, interface eth0 is being configured for routing
   protocol Babel, and statistics gathering is enabled.  For security,
   HMAC-SHA256 is supported.  Every sent Babel packet is signed with the
   key value provided, and every received Babel packet is verified with
   the same key value.

A.3.  Automatic Detection of Properties

   In this example, babeld is configured on two interfaces:

      interface eth0
      interface wlan0

   This says to run Babel on interfaces eth0 and wlan0.  Babeld will
   automatically detect that eth0 is wired and wlan0 is wireless and
   will configure the right parameters automatically.

A.4.  Override Default Properties

   In this example, babeld is configured on three interfaces:

      interface eth0
      interface eth1 type wireless
      interface tun0 type tunnel

   Here, interface eth1 is an Ethernet bridged to a wireless radio, so
   babeld's autodetection fails, and the interface type needs to be
   configured manually.  Tunnels are not detected automatically, so this
   needs to be specified.

   This is equivalent to the following:

      interface eth0 metric-algorithm 2-out-of-3 split-horizon true
      interface eth1 metric-algorithm etx split-horizon false
      interface tun0 metric-algorithm 2-out-of-3 split-horizon true

A.5.  Configuring Other Properties

   In this example, two interfaces are configured for babeld:

      interface eth0
      interface ppp0 hello-interval 30 update-interval 120

   Here, ppp0 is a metered 3G link used for fallback connectivity.  It
   runs with much higher than default time constants in order to avoid
   control traffic as much as possible.
