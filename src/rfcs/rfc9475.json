Similar impersonation is\r\nsometimes leveraged by bad actors in the text and multimedia\r\nmessaging space. This document explores the applicability of STIR's\r\nPersonal Assertion Token (PASSporT) and certificate issuance\r\nframework to text and multimedia messaging use cases, including\r\nsupport for both messages carried as a payload in SIP requests and\r\nmessages sent in sessions negotiated by SIP.","pub_date":"December 2023","keywords":["SIP"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9475","errata_url":null}
