      <t>
   RFC 2119 specifies common key words that may be used in protocol
   specifications.  This document aims to reduce the ambiguity by
   clarifying that only UPPERCASE usage of the key words have the
   defined special meanings.</t>

      <t>
   RFC 2119 specifies common key words, such as "MUST", "SHOULD", and
   "MAY", that may be used in protocol specifications.  It says that the
   key words "are often capitalized," which has caused confusion about
   how to interpret non-capitalized words such as "must" and "should".</t>
      <t>
   This document updates RFC 2119 by clarifying that only UPPERCASE
   usage of the key words have the defined special meanings.  This
   document is part of BCP 14.</t>

   The following change is made to <xref target="RFC2119" format="default"/>:</t>
      <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
=== OLD ===
In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:
]]></artwork>
      <t>
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</t>
      <artwork name="" type="" align="left" alt=""><![CDATA[
=== NEW ===
In many IETF documents, several words, when they are in all capitals
as shown below, are used to signify the requirements in the
specification.  These capitalized words can bring significant clarity
and consistency to documents because their meanings are well defined.
This document defines how those words are interpreted in IETF
documents when the words are in all capitals.
]]></artwork>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>These words can be used as defined here, but using them is not
      required.  Specifically, normative text does not require the use
      of these key words.  They are used for clarity and consistency
      when that is what's wanted, but a lot of normative text does not
      use them and is still normative.</li>
        <li>The words have the meanings specified herein only when they are in
      all capitals.</li>
        <li>When these words are not capitalized, they have their normal
      English meanings and are not affected by this document.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>
   Authors who follow these guidelines should incorporate this phrase
   near the beginning of their document:</t>
      <dl newline="false" spacing="normal" indent="3">
        <dt/>
        <dd>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",
      "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as
      described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119" format="default"/> [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
      appear in all capitals, as shown here.</dd>
