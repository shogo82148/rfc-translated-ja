      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">This document outlines a set of human rights protocol considerations for protocol developers. It provides questions that engineers should ask themselves when developing or improving protocols if they want to understand how their decisions can potentially influence the exercise of human rights on the Internet. It should be noted that the impact of a protocol cannot solely be deduced from its design, but its usage and implementation should also be studied to form a full human rights impact assessment.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">The questions are based on the research performed by the Human Rights Protocol Considerations (HRPC) Research Group, which has been documented before these considerations. The research establishes that human rights relate to standards and protocols and offers a common vocabulary of technical concepts that influence human rights and how these technical concepts can be combined to ensure that the Internet remains an enabling environment for human rights. With this, the contours of a model for developing human rights protocol considerations has taken shape.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-1">Threats to the exercise of human rights on the Internet come in many forms. Protocols and standards may harm or enable the right to freedom of expression; right to freedom of information; right to non-discrimination; right to equal protection; right to participate in cultural life, arts, and science; right to freedom of assembly and association; right to privacy; and right to security. An end user who is denied access to certain services or content may be unable to disclose vital information about the malpractices of a government or other authority. A person whose communications are monitored may be prevented or dissuaded from exercising their right to freedom of association or participate in political processes <xref target="Penney" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Penney"/>. In a worst-case scenario, protocols that leak information can lead to physical danger. A realistic example to consider is when individuals perceived as threats to the state are subjected to torture, extra-judicial killing, or detention on the basis of information gathered by state agencies through the monitoring of network traffic.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-2">This document presents several examples of how threats to human rights materialize on the Internet. This threat modeling is inspired by "<xref target="RFC6973" format="title" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Privacy Considerations for Internet Protocols"/>" <xref target="RFC6973" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6973"/>, which is based on security threat analysis. This method is a work in progress and by no means a perfect solution for assessing human rights risks in Internet protocols and systems. Certain specific human rights threats are indirectly considered in Internet protocols as part of the security considerations <xref target="RFC3552" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3552"/>; however, privacy considerations <xref target="RFC6973" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6973"/> or reviews, let alone human rights impact assessments of protocols, are neither standardized nor implemented.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-2-3">Many threats, enablers, and risks are linked to different rights. This is not surprising if one takes into account that human rights are interrelated, interdependent, and indivisible. However, here we're not discussing all human rights because not all human rights are relevant to Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in general and to protocols and standards in particular <xref target="Orwat" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Orwat"/>:</t>

This section provides guidance on how to conduct a human rights review, i.e., gauge the impact or potential impact of a protocol or standard on human rights.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-2">Human rights reviews can be done by any participant and can take place at different stages of the development process of an Internet-Draft. Generally speaking, it is easier to influence the development of a technology at earlier stages than at later stages. This does not mean that reviews at Last Call are not relevant, but they are less likely to result in significant changes in the reviewed document.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-3">Human rights reviews can be done by document authors, document shepherds, members of review teams, advocates, or impacted communities to influence the standards development process. IETF documents can benefit from people with different knowledge, perspectives, and backgrounds, especially since their implementations can impact many different communities as well.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-4">Methods for analyzing technology for specific human rights impacts are still quite nascent. Currently, five methods have been explored by the human rights review team, often in conjunction with each other.</t>

      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-1">This section provides guidance for document authors in the form of a questionnaire about protocols and how technical decisions can shape the exercise of human rights. The questionnaire may be useful at any point in the design process, particularly after the document authors have developed a high-level protocol model as described in <xref target="RFC4101" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC4101"/>. These guidelines do not seek to replace any existing referenced specifications but, rather, contribute to them and look at the design process from a human rights perspective.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-2">Protocols and Internet Standards might benefit from a documented discussion of potential human rights risks arising from potential misapplications of the protocol or technology described in the Request for Comments (RFC). This might be coupled with an Applicability Statement for that RFC.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-3">Note that the guidance provided in this section does not recommend specific practices. The range of protocols developed in the IETF is too broad to make recommendations about particular uses of data or how human rights might be balanced against other design goals.  However, by carefully considering the answers to the following questions, document authors should be able to produce a comprehensive analysis that can serve as the basis for discussion on whether the protocol adequately takes specific human rights threats into account. This guidance is meant to help the thought process of a human rights analysis; it does not provide specific directions for how to write a human rights considerations section (following the example set in <xref target="RFC6973" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6973"/>).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-4">In considering these questions, authors will need to be aware of the potential of technical advances or the passage of time to undermine protections.

        <name slugifiedName="name-intermediaries">Intermediaries</name>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-1">Question(s):
Does your protocol depend on or allow for protocol-specific functions at intermediary nodes?</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-2">Explanation:
	The end-to-end principle <xref target="Saltzer" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Saltzer"/> holds that certain functions can and should be performed at "ends" of the network. <xref target="RFC1958" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1958"/> states that "in very general terms, the community believes that the goal is connectivity ... and the intelligence is end to end rather than hidden in the network". There are new opportunities for failure when a protocol exchange includes both endpoints and an intermediary, especially when the intermediary is not under control of either endpoint, or is even largely invisible to it, for instance, as with intercepting HTTPS proxies <xref target="HTTPS-interception" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="HTTPS-interception"/>. This pattern also contributes to ossification because the intermediaries may impose protocol restrictions -- sometimes in violation of the specification -- that prevent the endpoints from using more modern protocols, as described in <xref target="RFC8446" sectionFormat="of" section="9.3" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8446#section-9.3" derivedContent="RFC8446"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-3">Note that intermediaries are distinct from services. In the former case, the third-party element is part of the protocol exchange; whereas in the latter, the endpoints communicate explicitly with the service. The client/server pattern provides clearer separation of responsibilities between elements than having an intermediary. However, even in client/server systems, it is often good practice to provide for end-to-end encryption between endpoints for protocol elements that are outside of the scope of the service, as in the design of Messaging Layer Security (MLS) <xref target="RFC9420" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9420"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.1-4">Example:
Encryption between the endpoints can be used to protect the protocol from interference by intermediaries. The encryption of transport layer information in QUIC <xref target="RFC9000" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9000"/> and of the TLS Server Name Indication (SNI) field <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-esni" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TLS-ESNI"/> are examples of this practice. One consequence of this is to limit the extent to which network operators can inspect traffic, requiring them to have control of the endpoints in order to monitor their behavior.</t>

Is your protocol fault tolerant? Does it downgrade gracefully, i.e., with mechanisms for fallback and/or notice? Can your protocol resist malicious degradation attempts?

Can your protocol maintain dependability and performance in the face of unanticipated changes or circumstances?</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.3-2">Explanation:
Reliability and resiliency ensures that a protocol will execute its function consistently and resistant to error, as described, and will function without unexpected results. Measures for reliability in protocols assure users that their intended communication was successfully executed.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.3-3">A system that is reliable degrades gracefully and will have a documented way to announce degradation. It will also have mechanisms to recover from failure gracefully and, if applicable, will allow for partial healing.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.3-4">It is important here to draw a distinction between random degradation and malicious degradation. Some attacks against previous versions of TLS, for example, exploited TLS' ability to gracefully downgrade to non-secure cipher suites <xref target="FREAK" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="FREAK"/> <xref target="Logjam" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Logjam"/>; from a functional perspective, this is useful, but from a security perspective, this can be disastrous.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.3-5">For reliability, it is necessary that services notify the users if a delivery fails. In the case of real-time systems, in addition to the reliable delivery, the protocol needs to safeguard timeliness.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.3-6">Example:
In the modern IP stack structure, a reliable transport layer requires an indication that transport processing has successfully completed, such as given by TCP's ACK message <xref target="RFC9293" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9293"/>.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.4-2">Example:
When network intermediaries are able to determine the type of content that a packet is carrying, then they can use that information to discriminate in favor of one type of content and against another. This impacts users' ability to send and receive the content of their choice.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.4-3">As recommended in <xref target="RFC8558" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8558"/>, protocol designers should avoid the construction of implicit signals of their content.

Does your protocol or specification define text string elements, in the payload or headers, that have to be understood or entered by humans? Does your specification allow Unicode?

If charsets or encodings other than UTF-8 are allowed, does your specification mandate a proper tagging of the charset? Did you have a look at <xref target="RFC6365" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6365"/>?</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.5-2">Explanation:
Internationalization refers to the practice of making protocols, standards, and implementations usable in different languages and scripts (see <xref target="localization" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.6"/> ("Localization")). In the IETF, internationalization means to add or improve the handling of non-ASCII text in a protocol <xref target="RFC6365" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC6365"/>. A different perspective, more appropriate to protocols that are designed for global use from the beginning, is the definition used by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) <xref target="W3Ci18nDef" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="W3Ci18nDef"/>:</t>
        <blockquote pn="section-4.5-3">Internationalization is the design and development of a product, application or document content that enables easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language.</blockquote>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.5-4">Many protocols that handle text only handle one charset (US-ASCII) or leave the question of what coded charset and encoding are used up to local guesswork (which leads, of course, to interoperability problems). If multiple charsets are permitted, they must be explicitly identified <xref target="RFC2277" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2277"/>.  Adding non-ASCII text to a protocol allows the protocol to handle more scripts, hopefully representing users across the world.  In today's world, that is normally best accomplished by allowing only Unicode encoded in UTF-8.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.5-5">In current IETF practice <xref target="RFC2277" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2277"/>, internationalization is aimed at user-facing strings, not protocol elements, such as the verbs used by some text-based protocols.

For our purposes, it can be described as the practice of translating an implementation to make it functional in a specific language or for users in a specific locale (see <xref target="internationalization" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4.5"/> ("Internationalization")). Internationalization is related to localization, but they are not the same. Internationalization is a necessary precondition for localization.</t>

The Internet is a global medium, but many of its protocols and products are developed with certain audiences in mind that often share particular characteristics like knowing how to read and write in American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) and knowing English. This limits the ability of a large part of the world's online population from using the Internet in a way that is culturally and linguistically accessible. An example of a standard that has taken into account the view that individuals like to have access to data in their preferred language can be found in <xref target="RFC5646" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC5646"/>. The document describes a way to label information with an identifier for the language in which it is written. And this allows information to be presented and accessed in more than one language.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.7-2">Explanation:
The Internet was able to be developed into the global network of networks because of the existence of open, non-proprietary standards <xref target="Zittrain" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Zittrain"/>.

        <blockquote pn="section-4.7-3">Various national and international standards bodies, such as ANSI, ISO, IEEE, and ITU-T, develop a variety of protocol and service specifications that are similar to Technical Specifications defined here [at the IETF]. National and international groups also publish "implementors' agreements" that are analogous to Applicability Statements, capturing a body of implementation-specific detail concerned with the practical application of their standards. All of these are considered to be "open external standards" for the purposes of the Internet Standards Process.</blockquote>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.7-4">Similarly, <xref target="RFC3935" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3935"/> does not define open standards but does emphasize the importance of an "open process", i.e.:</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.7-6">Open standards (and open source software) allow users to glean information about how the tools they are using work, including the tools' security and privacy properties. They additionally allow for permissionless innovation, which is important to maintain the freedom and ability to freely create and deploy new protocols on top of the communications constructs that currently exist. It is at the heart of the Internet as we know it, and to maintain its fundamentally open nature, we need to be mindful of the need for developing open standards.</t>

Does your protocol support heterogeneity by design? Does your protocol allow for multiple types of hardware? Does your protocol allow for multiple types of application protocols? Is your protocol liberal in what it receives and handles? Will it remain usable and open if the context changes?</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.8-2">Explanation:
The Internet is characterized by heterogeneity on many levels: devices, nodes, router scheduling algorithms, queue management mechanisms, routing protocols, levels of multiplexing, protocol versions and implementations, and underlying link layers (e.g., point-to-point, multi-access links, wireless, Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), etc.) in the traffic mix and in the levels of congestion at different times and places. Moreover, as the Internet is composed of autonomous organizations and ISPs, each with their own separate policy concerns, there is a large heterogeneity of administrative domains and pricing structures. As a result, the heterogeneity principle proposed in <xref target="RFC1958" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC1958"/> needs to be supported by design <xref target="FIArch" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="FIArch"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.8-3">Heterogeneity support in protocols can, thus, enable a wide range of devices and (by extension) users to participate on the network.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.8-4">Example:
Heterogeneity significantly contributed to the success of the Internet architecture <xref target="Zittrain" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Zittrain"/>. There is a famous quote often attributed to Niels Bohr: "Prediction is very difficult, especially if it's about the future." This also holds true for future uses of the Internet architecture and infrastructure. Therefore, as a rule of thumb, it is important to -- as far as possible -- design your protocol for different devices and uses, especially at lower layers of the stack. However, if you choose not to do this, it could be relevant to document the reasoning for that.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.9-2">Explanation:
Adaptability is closely interrelated with permissionless innovation: both maintain the freedom and ability to create and deploy new protocols on top of the communications constructs that currently exist. It is at the heart of the Internet as we know it, and to maintain its fundamentally open nature, we need to be mindful of the impact of protocols on maintaining or reducing permissionless innovation to ensure that the Internet can continue to develop.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.9-3">Adaptability and permissionless innovation can be used to shape information networks as groups of users prefer. Furthermore, a precondition of adaptability is the ability of the people who can adapt the network to be able to know and understand the network. This is why adaptability and permissionless innovation are inherently connected to the right to education and the right to science as well as the right to freedom of assembly and association and the right to freedom of expression, since it allows the users of the network to determine how to assemble, collaborate, and express themselves.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.15.1-2">Example: In the development of the IPv6 protocol, it was discussed to
embed a Media Access Control (MAC) address into unique IP
addresses. This would make it possible for eavesdroppers and other
information collectors to identify when different addresses used in
different transactions actually correspond to the same node. This is
why standardization efforts like "<xref target="RFC8981" format="title" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Temporary Address Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6"/>" <xref target="RFC8981" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8981"/> and MAC address
randomization <xref target="I-D.ietf-madinas-mac-address-randomization" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="MAC-ADDRESS-RANDOMIZATION"/> have been
pursued.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-4.15.1-3">Note that it is often attractive to try to create a pseudonym from

email addresses and recover the original address <xref target="Email-hashing" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Email-hashing"/>.</t>

        <name slugifiedName="name-censorship-resistance">Censorship Resistance</name>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.16-1">Question(s):
Does your protocol architecture facilitate censorship? Does it include "choke points" that are easy to use for censorship? Does it expose identifiers that can be used to selectively block certain kinds of traffic? Could it be designed to be more censorship resistant? Does your protocol make it apparent or transparent when access to a resource is restricted and why it is restricted?</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.16-2">Explanation:
Governments and service providers block or filter content or traffic, often without the knowledge of end users <xref target="RFC7754" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7754"/>. For a survey of censorship techniques employed across the world, see <xref target="RFC9505" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9505"/>, which lays out protocol properties that have been exploited to censor access to information. Censorship resistance refers to the methods and measures to prevent Internet censorship.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.16-3">Example:
The current design of the Web has a number of architectural choke points where it is possible for censors to intervene. These include obtaining the control of the domain name itself, DNS blocking either at the protocol layer or at the resolver, IP address blocking, and blocking at the web server. There has been extensive work on content distribution systems, which are intended to be more censorship resistant; and some, such as BitTorrent, are in wide use. However, these systems may have inferior reliability and performance compared to the Web (e.g., they do not support active content on the server).</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.16-4">Example:
Identifiers of content exposed within a protocol might be used to facilitate censorship by allowing the censor to determine which traffic to block. DNS queries, the "host" request header in an HTTP request, and the Server Name Indication (SNI) in a Transport Layer Security (TLS) ClientHello are all examples of protocol elements that can travel in plaintext and be used by censors to identify what content a user is trying to access <xref target="RFC9505" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC9505"/>. Protocol mechanisms such as Encrypted ClientHello <xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-esni" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="TLS-ESNI"/> or DNS over HTTPS <xref target="RFC8484" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8484"/> that encrypt metadata provide some level of resistance to this type of protocol inspection. Full traffic encryption systems, such as Tor <eref target="https://torproject.org" brackets="angle"/>, can also be used by people to access otherwise censored resources.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.16-5">Example: As noted above, one way to censor web traffic is to require the server to block it or require ISPs to block requests to the server. In HTTP, denial or restriction of access can be made apparent by the use of status code 451, which allows server operators and intermediaries to operate with greater transparency in circumstances where issues of law or public policy affect their operation <xref target="RFC7725" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7725"/>. If a protocol potentially enables censorship, protocol designers should strive towards creating error codes that capture different scenarios (e.g., blocked due to administrative policy, unavailable because of legal requirements, etc.) to minimize ambiguity for end users.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.17-3">Example: Lack of authenticity may lead to lack of integrity and negative externalities; of which, spam is an example. Lack of data that could be used for billing and accounting can lead to so-called "free" arrangements that obscure the actual costs and distribution of the costs, for example, the barter arrangements that are commonly used for Internet interconnection, and the commercial exploitation of personal data for targeted advertising, which is the most common funding model for the so-called "free" services such as search engines and social networks. Unexpected outcomes might not be technical but rather architectural, social, or economic.

        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.18-2">Explanation:
Sometimes in the design of protocols, websites, web technologies, or web tools, barriers are created that exclude people from using the Web. The Internet should be designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability. When the Internet technologies meet this goal, it will be accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability <xref target="W3CAccessibility" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="W3CAccessibility"/>.</t>

Can your protocol be implemented without a single point of control? If applicable, can your protocol be deployed in a federated manner? Does your protocol create additional centralized points of control?</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.19-2">Explanation:
Decentralization is one of the central technical concepts of the architecture of the Internet and is embraced as such by the IETF <xref target="RFC3935" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3935"/>. It refers to the absence or minimization of centralized points of control, a feature that is assumed to make it easy for new users to join and new uses to unfold <xref target="Ziewitz" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Ziewitz"/>. It also reduces issues surrounding single points of failure and distributes the network such that it continues to function even if one or several nodes are disabled. With the commercialization of the Internet in the early 1990s, there has been a slow move away from decentralization, to the detriment of the technical benefits of having a decentralized Internet. For a more detailed discussion of this topic, please see <xref target="I-D.arkko-iab-internet-consolidation" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Arkko"/>.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.19-3">Example:
The bits traveling the Internet are increasingly susceptible to monitoring and censorship from both governments and ISPs as well as third (malicious) parties. The ability to monitor and censor is further enabled by the increased centralization of the network that creates central infrastructure points that can be tapped into. The creation of peer-to-peer networks and the development of voice-over-IP protocols using peer-to-peer technology in combination with Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for scalability are examples of how protocols can preserve decentralization <xref target="I-D.pouwelse-censorfree-scenarios" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Pouwelse"/>.</t>

Access to remedy may help victims of human rights violations in seeking justice or allow law enforcement agencies to identify a possible violator. However, current mechanisms in protocols that try to enable "attribution" to individuals impede the exercise of the right to privacy. The former UN Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression has also argued that anonymity is an inherent part of freedom of expression <xref target="Kaye" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Kaye"/>. Considering the potential adverse impact of attribution on the right to privacy and freedom of expression, enabling attribution on an individual level is most likely not consistent with human rights.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-4.20-3">Example: Adding personally identifiable information to data streams as a means to enable the human right to remedy might help in identifying a violator of human rights and provide access to remedy, but this would disproportionately affect all users right to privacy, anonymous expression, and association.

            <t indent="0">   Many of us have held a vision of the Internet as the ultimate
   distributed platform that allows communication, the provision of
   services, and competition from any corner of the world.  But as the
   Internet has matured, it seems to also feed the creation of large,
   centralised entities in many areas.  This phenomenon could be looked
   at from many different angles, but this memo considers the topic from
   the perspective of how available technology and Internet architecture
   drives different market directions.

            <t indent="0">The Internet is structured to be an open communications medium. This openness is one of the key underpinnings of Internet innovation, but it can also allow communications that may be viewed as undesirable by certain parties. Thus, as the Internet has grown, so have mechanisms to limit the extent and impact of abusive or objectionable communications. Recently, there has been an increasing emphasis on "blocking" and "filtering", the active prevention of such communications. This document examines several technical approaches to Internet blocking and filtering in terms of their alignment with the overall Internet architecture. When it is possible to do so, the approach to blocking and filtering that is most coherent with the Internet architecture is to inform endpoints about potentially undesirable services, so that the communicants can avoid engaging in abusive or objectionable communications. We observe that certain filtering and blocking approaches can cause unintended consequences to third parties, and we discuss the limits of efficacy of various approaches.</t>

The profiles provide guidelines on the composition of DHCP or DHCPv6 messages, designed to minimize disclosure of identifying information.</t>

            <t indent="0">This document discusses the nature of signals seen by on-path elements examining transport protocols, contrasting implicit and explicit signals. For example, TCP's state machine uses a series of well-known messages that are exchanged in the clear. Because these are visible to network elements on the path between the two nodes setting up the transport connection, they are often used as signals by those network elements. In transports that do not exchange these messages in the clear, on-path network elements lack those signals. Often, the removal of those signals is intended by those moving the messages to confidential channels. Where the endpoints desire that network elements along the path receive these signals, this document recommends explicit signals be used.</t>

Additionally, it reduces the window of exposure of a host as being accessible via an address that becomes revealed as a result of active communication. This document obsoletes RFC 4941.</t>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">This document provides enhancements of real-time text (as specified in RFC 4103) suitable for mixing in a centralized conference model, enabling source identification and rapidly interleaved transmission of text from different sources. The intended use is for real-time text mixers and participant endpoints capable of providing an efficient presentation or other treatment of a multiparty real-time text session. The specified mechanism builds on the standard use of the Contributing Source (CSRC) list in the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) packet for source identification. The method makes use of the same "text/t140" and "text/red" formats as for two-party sessions.</t>
            <t indent="0">Solutions using multiple RTP streams in the same RTP session are briefly mentioned, as they could have some benefits over the RTP-mixer model. The RTP-mixer model was selected to be used for the fully specified solution in this document because it can be applied to a wide range of existing RTP implementations.</t>
            <t indent="0">A capability exchange is specified so that it can be verified that a mixer and a participant can handle the multiparty-coded real-time text stream using the RTP-mixer method. The capability is indicated by the use of a Session Description Protocol (SDP) (RFC 8866) media attribute, "rtt-mixer".</t>

TCP is an important transport-layer protocol in the Internet protocol stack, and it has continuously evolved over decades of use and growth of the Internet. Over this time, a number of changes have been made to TCP as it was specified in RFC 793, though these have only been documented in a piecemeal fashion. This document collects and brings those changes together with the protocol specification from RFC 793. This document obsoletes RFC 793, as well as RFCs 879, 2873, 6093, 6429, 6528, and 6691 that updated parts of RFC 793. It updates RFCs 1011 and 1122, and it should be considered as a replacement for the portions of those documents dealing with TCP requirements. It also updates RFC 5961 by adding a small clarification in reset handling while in the SYN-RECEIVED state. The TCP header control bits from RFC 793 have also been updated based on RFC 3168.</t>
