      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">The Internet Architecture Board (IAB) holds occasional workshops
      designed to consider long-term issues and strategies for the
      Internet, and to suggest future directions for the Internet
      architecture.  This long-term planning function of the IAB is
      complementary to the ongoing engineering efforts performed by working
      groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">User privacy and security are constantly being improved by increasingly strong and more widely deployed encryption. This workshop aims to discuss ways to improve network management techniques in support of even broader adoption of encryption on the Internet.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">Network management techniques need to evolve to work effectively and reliably in the presence of ubiquitous traffic encryption and to support user privacy. In an all-encrypted network, it is not viable to rely on unencrypted metadata for network monitoring and security functions, troubleshooting devices, and passive traffic measurements. New approaches are needed to track network behaviors, e.g., by directly cooperating with endpoints and applications, increasing use of in-band telemetry, increasing use of active measurement approaches, and privacy-preserving inference techniques.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">The aim of this IAB online workshop from October 17-19, 2022, has been to provide a platform to explore the interaction between network management and traffic encryption and to initiate work on collaborative approaches that promote security and user privacy while supporting operational requirements. As such, the workshop addressed the following questions:</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.1-1">Many existing network management techniques are passive in nature: they don't rely on explicit signals from end hosts to negotiate with network middleboxes but instead rely on inspecting packets to recognize traffic and apply various policies. Traffic classification, as a passive technique, is being challenged by increasing encryption.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.1-2">Traffic classification is commonly performed by networks to infer what applications and services are being used. This information is in turn used for capacity and resource planning, Quality-of-Service (QoS) monitoring, traffic prioritization, network access control, identity management, and malware detection. However, since classification commonly relies on recognizing unencrypted properties of packets in a flow, increasing encryption of traffic can decrease the effectiveness of classification.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.1-3">The amount of classification that can be performed on traffic also provides useful insight into how "leaky" the protocols used by applications are and points to areas where information is visible to any observer, who may or may not be malicious.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.1-4">Frequently, classification has been based on specific rules crafted by experts, but there is also a move toward using machine learning to recognize patterns. "Deep learning" machine-learning models generally rely on analyzing a large set of traffic over time and have trouble reacting quickly to changes in traffic patterns.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.1-5">Models that are based on closed-world data sets also become less useful over time as traffic changes. <xref target="JIANG" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="JIANG"/> describes experiments that show that a model that performed with high accuracy on an initial data set becomes severely degraded when running on a newer data set that contains traffic from the same applications. Even in as little time as one week, the traffic classification would become degraded. However, the set of features in packets and flows that were useful for models stayed mostly consistent, even if the models themselves needed to be updated. Models where the feature space is reduced to fewer features showed better resiliency and could be retrained more quickly. Based on this, <xref target="JIANG" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="JIANG"/> recommends more work and research to determine which set of features in IP packets are most useful for focused machine-learning analysis. <xref target="WU" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="WU"/> also recommends further research investment in Artificial Intelligence (AI) analysis for network management.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.2-1">Just as traffic classification is continually adapting, techniques to prevent traffic analysis and to obfuscate application and user traffic are continually evolving. An invited talk from the authors of <xref target="DITTO" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DITTO"/> shared a novel approach with the workshop for how to build a very robust system to prevent unwanted traffic analysis.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.2-2">Usually traffic obfuscation is performed by changing the timing of packets or by adding padding to data. The practices can be costly and negatively impact performance. <xref target="DITTO" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="DITTO"/> demonstrated the feasibility of applying traffic obfuscation on aggregated traffic in the network with minimal overhead and inline speed.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.2-3">While traffic obfuscation techniques are not widely deployed today, this study underlines the need for continuous effort to keep traffic models updated over time, the challenges of the classification of encrypted traffic, as well as the opportunities to further enhance user privacy.</t>

These guidelines and principles provide another view on the discussion of passive classification and analysis of traffic.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.3-2">Consent for collection and measurement of metadata is an important consideration in deploying network measurement techniques. This consent can be given explicitly as informed consent, given by proxy, or may be only implied. For example, a user of a network might need to consent to certain measurement and traffic treatment when joining a network.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.3-3">Various techniques for data collection can also improve user privacy, such as discarding data after a short period of time, masking aspects of data that contain user-identifying information, reducing the accuracy of collected data, and aggregating data.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.4-1">The intents and goals of users, application developers, and network operators align in some cases, but not in others. One of the recurring challenges that was discussed was the lack of a clear way to understand or to communicate intents and requirements. Both traffic classification and traffic obfuscation attempt to change the visibility of traffic without cooperation of other parties: traffic classification is an attempt by the network to inspect application traffic without coordination from applications, and traffic obfuscation is an attempt by the application to hide that same traffic as it transits a network.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.4-2">Traffic adaptation and prioritization is one dimension in which the incentives for cooperation seem most clear. Even if an application is trying to prevent the leaking of metadata, it could benefit from signals from the network about sudden capacity changes that can help it adapt its application quality, such as bitrates and codecs. Such signaling may not be appropriate for the most privacy-sensitive applications, like Tor, but could be applicable for many others. There are existing protocols that involve explicit signaling between applications and networks, such as Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) <xref target="RFC3168" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC3168"/>, but that has yet to see wide adoption.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.4-3">Managed networks (such as private corporate networks) were brought up in several comments as particularly challenging for meeting management requirements while maintaining encryption and privacy. These networks can have legal and regulated requirements for detection of specific fraudulent or malicious traffic.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.1.4-4">Personal networks that enable managed parental controls have similar complications with encrypted traffic and user privacy. In these scenarios, the parental controls that are operated by the network may be as simple as a DNS filter, which can be made ineffective by a device routing traffic to an alternate DNS resolver.</t>

        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2-1">The second day of the workshop focused on the emerging techniques for analyzing, managing, or monitoring encrypted traffic. Presentations covered advanced classification and identification, including machine-learning techniques, for the purposes of managing network flows or monitoring or monetizing usage.</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2-2">After an introduction that covered the goals of the workshop and the starting questions (as described in <xref target="intro" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 1"/>), there were three presentations, followed by open discussion.</t>
        <section anchor="first-party-collaboration-for-network-management" numbered="true" removeInRFC="false" toc="include" pn="section-2.2.1">
          <name slugifiedName="name-first-party-collaboration-f">First-Party Collaboration for Network Management</name>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.1-1">It is the intent of end-to-end encryption of traffic to create a barrier between entities inside the communication channel and everyone else, including network operators. Therefore, any attempt to overcome that intentional barrier requires collaboration between the inside and outside entities. At a minimum, those entities must agree on the benefits of overcoming the barrier (or solving the problem), agree that costs are proportional to the benefits, and agree to additional limitations or safeguards against bad behavior by collaborators including other non-insiders <xref target="BARNES" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="BARNES"/>.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.1-2">The Internet is designed interoperably, which means an outside entity wishing to collaborate with the inside might be any number of intermediaries and not, say, a specific person that can be trusted in the human sense. Additionally, the use of encryption, especially network-layer or transport-layer encryption, introduces dynamic or opportunistic or perfunctory discoverability. These realities point to a need to ask why an outside entity might make an engineering case to collaborate with the user of a network with encrypted traffic and to ask whether the trade-offs and potential risks are worth it to the user.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.1-3">However, the answers cannot be specific, and the determinations or guidance need to be general as the encryption boundary is inevitably an application used by many people. Trade-offs must make sense to users who are unlikely to be thinking about network management considerations. Harms need to be preemptively reduced because, in general terms, few users would choose network management benefits over their own privacy if given the choice.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.1-4">Some have found that there appears to be little, if any, evidence
that encryption causes network problems that are meaningful to the user. Since
alignment on problem solving is a prerequisite to collaboration on a
solution, it does not seem that collaboration across the encryption
boundary is called for.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.2-1">Even with the wide-scale deployment of encryption in new protocols and of techniques that prevent passive observers of network traffic from knowing the content of exchanged communications, important information, such as which parties communicate and sometimes even which services have been requested, may still be able to be deduced. The future is to conceal more data and metadata from passive observers and also to minimize information exposure to second parties (where the user is the first party) by, maybe counterintuitively, introducing third-party relay services to intermediate communications. As discussed in <xref target="KUEHLEWIND" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="KUEHLEWIND"/>, the relay is a mechanism that uses additional levels of encryption to separate two important pieces of information: knowledge of the identity of the person accessing a service is separated from knowledge about the service being accessed. By contrast, a VPN uses only one level of encryption and does not separate identity (first party) and service (second party) metadata.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.2-2">Relay mechanisms are termed "oblivious", there is a future for specifications in privacy-preserving measurement (PPM), and protocols like Multiplexed Application Substrate over QUIC Encryption (MASQUE) are discussed in the IETF. In various schemes, users are ideally able to share their identity only with the entity they have identified as a trusted one. That data is not shared with the service provider. However, this is more complicated for network management, but there may be opportunities for better collaboration between the network and, say, the application or service at the endpoint.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.2-3">A queriable relay mechanism could preserve network management functions that are disrupted by encryption, such as TCP optimization, quality of service, zero-rating, parental controls, access control, redirection, content enhancement, analytics, and fraud prevention. Instead of encrypting communication between only two ends with passive observation by all on-path elements, intermediate relays could be introduced as trusted parties that get to see limited information for the purpose of collaboration between in-network intermediary services.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.3-1">Out of all of the possible network management functions that might be ameliorated by proxying, the ability to control congestion in encrypted communications has been researched in depth. These techniques are realized based on TCP performance-enhancing proxies (PEPs) that either entirely intercept a TCP connection or interfere with the transport information in the TCP header. However, despite the challenge that the new encrypted protocol will limit any such in-network interference, these techniques can also have a negative impact on the evolvability of these protocols. Therefore, a new approach was presented where, instead of manipulating existing information, additional information is sent using a so-called sidecar protocol independent of the main transport protocol that is used end to end <xref target="WELZL" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="WELZL"/>. For example, sidecar information can contain additional acknowledgments to enable in-network local retransmission or faster end-to-end retransmission by reducing the signaling round-trip time.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.3-2">Taking user privacy benefits for granted, there is a need to investigate the comparable performance outputs of various encrypted traffic configurations such as the use of an additional sidecar protocol, or explicit encrypted and trusted network communication using MASQUE in relation to existing techniques such as TCP PEPs, etc.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.4-1">One size fits all? On the issue of trust, different networks or devices will have different trust requirements for devices, users, or each other, and vice versa. For example, imagine two networks with really different security requirements, like a home network with a requirement to protect its child users versus a national security institution's network. How could one network architecture solve the needs of all use cases?</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.4-2">Does our destination have consequences? It seems sometimes that there may be future consequences caused by the ubiquitous, strong encryption of network traffic because it will cause intermediaries to poke holes in what are supposed to be long-term solutions for user privacy and security.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.2.4-3">Can we bring the user along? While there has been a focus on the good reasons why people might collaborate across the encryption barrier, there will always be others who want to disrupt that in order to exploit the data for their own gain, and sometimes exploitation is called innovation. High-level policy mitigations have exposed how powerless end users are against corporate practices of data harvesting. And yet interfaces to help users understand these lower-layer traffic flows to protect their financial transactions or privacy haven't been achieved yet. That means that engineers must make inferences about user wants. Instead, we should make these relationships and trade-offs more visible.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.3.1-1">For enterprise networks where client behavior is
potentially managed, <xref target="COLLINS" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="COLLINS"/> proposes "Improving network
monitoring through contracts", where contracts describe different
states of network behavior.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.3.1-2">Because network operators have a limited amount of time to focus on
problems and process alerts, contracts and states let the operator
focus on a particular aspect of a current situation or problem.  The
current estimate for the number of events a Security Operations Center (SOC) operator can handle
is about 10 per hour.  Operators must work within the limits imposed
by their organization and must pick among options that frequently
only frustrate attackers -- preventing attacks entirely is potentially
impossible. Finally, operators must prioritize and manage the most
events possible.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.3.1-3">Validating which alerts are true positives is challenging because lots
of weird traffic creates many anomalies, and not all anomalies are
malicious events.  Identifying which anomalous traffic is rooted in
malicious activity with any level of certainty is extremely
challenging.  Unfortunately, applying the latest machine-learning
techniques has produced mixed results.  To make matters worse,
the large amounts of Internet-wide scanning has resulted in endless
traffic that is technically malicious but only creates an information
overload and challenges event prioritization.  Any path forward must
free up analyst time to concentrate on the more
challenging events.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.3.1-4">The proposed contract solution is to define a collection of acceptable
behaviors that comprises different states that might
include IP addresses, domain names, and indicators of compromise.
Deviation from a contract might indicate that a system is acting
outside a normal mode of behavior or even that a normal mode of
behavior is suddenly missing.  An example contract might be "this
system is expected to update its base OS once a day". If this
doesn't occur, then this expectation has not been met, and the system
should be checked as it failed to call home to look for (potentially
security-related) updates.</t>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.3.2-1">The world is not only shifting to increased encrypted traffic but is
also encrypting more and more of the metadata (e.g., DNS queries and
responses).  This makes network policy enforcement by middleboxes
significantly more challenging.  The result is a
significant tension between security enforcement and privacy
protection.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.3.2-2">Goals for solving this problem should include
enabling networks to enforce their policies, but
should not include the weakening of encryption nor the deployment of new server software.  Existing
solutions fail to meet at least one of these points.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.3.2-3">A cryptographic principle of a "zero-knowledge proof" (ZKP) <xref target="GRUBBS" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="GRUBBS"/>
may be one path forward to consider.  A ZKP allows a third party to
verify that a statement is true without revealing what the statement
actually is.  Applying this to network traffic has been shown to allow
a middlebox to verify that traffic to a web server is
compliant with a policy without revealing the actual contents.  This
solution meets the three criteria listed above.  Using ZKP within TLS 1.3
traffic turns out to be plausible.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.3.2-4">An example engine using encrypted DNS was built to test ZKP.  Clients
were able to create DNS requests that were not listed within a DNS
block list.  Middleboxes could verify, without knowing the exact
request, that the client's DNS request was not on the prohibited list.
Although the result was functional, the computational overhead was
still too slow, and future work will be needed to decrease the ZKP-imposed 
latencies.</t>

conflict between filtering and privacy.  Network operators need to
implement policies and regulations that can originate from many
locations (e.g., security, governmental, parental, etc.).  Conversely,
clients need to protect their users' privacy and security.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-2.3.3-2">Safe browsing, originally created by Google, is one example of a
mechanism that tries to meet both sides of this conflict.  It would be
beneficial to standardize this and other similar mechanisms.
Operating systems could continually protect their users by ensuring
that malicious destinations are not being reached.  This would require
some coordination between cooperating clients and servers offering
protection services.  These collaborative solutions may be the best
compromise to resolve the tension between privacy services and protection services

      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-1">Looking forward, the workshop participants identified that solving the

        <li pn="section-3-2.1">

        </li>
        <li pn="section-3-2.3">
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3-2.3.1">There is an unanswered question of whether or not network operators are willing to participate by allowing new encryption technologies into their environment in exchange for technologies that prove their clients are being good net-citizens. If so, some of these solutions might be required to exist before networks allow a certain type of increased encryption; consider the example of TLS Encrypted Client Hello being blocked by some network operators.</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-3">The breadth of the problem space itself is another complicating
factor.  There is a wide variety of network architectures, and each
has different requirements for both data encryption and network
management.  Each problem space will have multiple, different encumbrances:
for example, technical, legal, data ownership,
and regulatory concerns.  New network architectures might be needed to
solve this problem at a larger scope, which would in turn require
interoperability support from network product vendors.  Education about
various solutions will be required in order to ensure regulation and
policy organizations can understand and thus support the deployment of
developed solutions.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-3-4">After new technologies and related standards are developed and deployed,
unintended consequences can emerge.
These lead to effects in multiple directions:
on one hand, exposed protocol values not intended for network management
might be used by networks to differentiate traffic; on the other hand,
changes to a protocol that break existing use cases might have an impact on private network deployments.
While making decisions on technology
direction and protocol design, it is important to consider the impact on
various kinds of network deployments and their unique requirements.
When protocols change to make different network management functions
easier or harder, the impact on various deployment models ought to be
considered and documented.</t>

            <t indent="0">   Internet measurement is important to researchers from industry,
   academia and civil society.  While measurement of the internet can
   give insight into the functioning and usage of the internet, it can
   present risks to user privacy and safety.  This document describes
   briefly those risks and proposes guidelines for ensuring that
   internet measurements can be carried out safely, with examples.
