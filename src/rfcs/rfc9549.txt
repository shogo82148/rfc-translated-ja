1.  Introduction

   This document updates the Introduction in Section 1, the Name
   Constraints certificate extension discussion in Section 4.2.1.10, and
   the Processing Rules for Internationalized Names in Section 7 of RFC
   5280 [RFC5280] to provide alignment with the 2008 specification for
   Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) and includes support for
   internationalized email addresses in X.509 certificates.

   An IDN in Unicode (native character) form contains at least one
   U-label [RFC5890].  IDNs are carried in certificates in ACE-encoded
   form.  That is, all U-labels within an IDN are converted to A-labels.
   Conversion of a U-label to an A-label is described in [RFC5891].

   The GeneralName structure supports many different name forms,
   including otherName for extensibility.  RFC 8398 [RFC8398] specifies
   the SmtpUTF8Mailbox for internationalized email addresses.

   Note that Internationalized Domain Names in Applications
   specifications published in 2003 (IDNA2003) [RFC3490] and 2008
   (IDNA2008) [RFC5890] both refer to the Punycode algorithm for
   conversion [RFC3492].

   Note that characters in the Unicode Category "Symbol, Other" (So) are
   specifically not included in IDNA2003 [RFC3490] or IDNA2008
   [RFC5890]; the derived property values for characters in this
   category are calculated as DISALLOWED.  Thus, some characters that
   are allowed under the Unicode IDNA Compatibility Processing [UTS46]
   are not allowed under this specification.  For instance, ♚.example,
   which contains the Unicode character U+1F0A1 (BLACK CHESS KING),
   results in a failure under this specification, but it becomes
   xn--45h.example under [UTS46].

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Changes since RFC 8399

   In some cases, [RFC8399] required conversion of A-labels to U-labels
   in order to process name constraints for internationalized email
   addresses.  This led to implementation complexity and at least two
   security vulnerabilities.  One summary of the vulnerabilities can be
   found in [DDHQ].  Now, all IDNs are carried and processed as
   A-labels.

   The Introduction provides a warning to implementers about the
   handling of characters in the Unicode Category "Symbol, Other" (So),
   which includes emoji characters.

2.  Updates to RFC 5280

   This section provides updates to several paragraphs of [RFC5280].
   For clarity, if the entire section is not replaced, then the original
   text and the replacement text are shown.

2.1.  Update in the Introduction (Section 1)

   This update provides references for IDNA2008.

   OLD

   |  *  Enhanced support for internationalized names is specified in
   |     Section 7, with rules for encoding and comparing
   |     Internationalized Domain Names, Internationalized Resource
   |     Identifiers (IRIs), and distinguished names.  These rules are
   |     aligned with comparison rules established in current RFCs,
   |     including [RFC3490], [RFC3987], and [RFC4518].

   NEW

   |  *  Enhanced support for internationalized names is specified in
   |     Section 7, with rules for encoding and comparing
   |     Internationalized Domain Names, Internationalized Resource
   |     Identifiers (IRIs), and distinguished names.  These rules are
   |     aligned with comparison rules established in current RFCs,
   |     including [RFC3987], [RFC4518], [RFC5890], and [RFC5891].

2.2.  Update in Name Constraints (Section 4.2.1.10)

   This update removes the ability to include constraints for a
   particular mailbox.  This capability was not used, and removing it
   allows name constraints to apply to email addresses in rfc822Name and
   SmtpUTF8Mailbox [RFC8398] within otherName.

   OLD

   |  A name constraint for Internet mail addresses MAY specify a
   |  particular mailbox, all addresses at a particular host, or all
   |  mailboxes in a domain.  To indicate a particular mailbox, the
   |  constraint is the complete mail address.  For example,
   |  "root@example.com" indicates the root mailbox on the host
   |  "example.com".  To indicate all Internet mail addresses on a
   |  particular host, the constraint is specified as the host name.
   |  For example, the constraint "example.com" is satisfied by any mail
   |  address at the host "example.com".  To specify any address within
   |  a domain, the constraint is specified with a leading period (as
   |  with URIs).  For example, ".example.com" indicates all the
   |  Internet mail addresses in the domain "example.com", but not
   |  Internet mail addresses on the host "example.com".

   NEW

   |  A name constraint for Internet mail addresses MAY specify all
   |  addresses at a particular host or all mailboxes in a domain.  To
   |  indicate all Internet mail addresses on a particular host, the
   |  constraint is specified as the host name.  For example, the
   |  constraint "example.com" is satisfied by any mail address at the
   |  host "example.com".  To specify any address within a domain, the
   |  constraint is specified with a leading period (as with URIs).  For
   |  example, ".example.com" indicates all the Internet mail addresses
   |  in the domain "example.com" but not Internet mail addresses on the
   |  host "example.com".

2.3.  Update in IDNs in GeneralName (Section 7.2)

   This update aligns with IDNA2008.  Since all of Section 7.2 of
   [RFC5280] is replaced, the OLD text is not provided.

   NEW

   |  Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) may be included in
   |  certificates and CRLs in the subjectAltName and issuerAltName
   |  extensions, name constraints extension, authority information
   |  access extension, subject information access extension, CRL
   |  distribution points extension, and issuing distribution point
   |  extension.  Each of these extensions uses the GeneralName type;
   |  one choice in GeneralName is the dNSName field, which is defined
   |  as type IA5String.
   |  
   |  IA5String is limited to the set of ASCII characters.  To
   |  accommodate IDNs, U-labels are converted to A-labels.  The A-label
   |  is the encoding of the U-label according to the Punycode algorithm
   |  [RFC3492] with the ACE prefix "xn--" added at the beginning of the
   |  string.
   |  
   |  When comparing DNS names for equality, conforming implementations
   |  MUST perform a case-insensitive exact match on the entire DNS
   |  name.  When evaluating name constraints, conforming
   |  implementations MUST perform a case-insensitive exact match on a
   |  label-by-label basis.  As noted in Section 4.2.1.10, any DNS name
   |  that may be constructed by adding labels to the left-hand side of
   |  the domain name given as the constraint is considered to fall
   |  within the indicated subtree.
   |  
   |  Implementations that have a user interface SHOULD convert IDNs to
   |  Unicode for display.  Specifically, conforming implementations
   |  convert A-labels to U-labels for display purposes.
   |  
   |  Implementation consideration: There are increased memory
   |  requirements for IDNs.  An IDN ACE label will begin with the four
   |  additional characters "xn--", and an IDN can require as many as
   |  five ASCII characters to specify a single international character.

2.4.  Update in IDNs in Distinguished Names (Section 7.3)

   This update aligns with IDNA2008.

   OLD

   |  Domain Names may also be represented as distinguished names using
   |  domain components in the subject field, the issuer field, the
   |  subjectAltName extension, or the issuerAltName extension.  As with
   |  the dNSName in the GeneralName type, the value of this attribute
   |  is defined as an IA5String.  Each domainComponent attribute
   |  represents a single label.  To represent a label from an IDN in
   |  the distinguished name, the implementation MUST perform the
   |  "ToASCII" label conversion specified in Section 4.1 of RFC 3490.
   |  The label SHALL be considered a "stored string".  That is, the
   |  AllowUnassigned flag SHALL NOT be set.

   NEW

   |  Domain names may also be represented as distinguished names using
   |  domain components in the subject field, the issuer field, the
   |  subjectAltName extension, or the issuerAltName extension.  As with
   |  the dNSName in the GeneralName type, the value of this attribute
   |  is defined as an IA5String.  Each domainComponent attribute
   |  represents a single label.  To represent a label from an IDN in
   |  the distinguished name, the implementation MUST convert all
   |  U-labels to A-labels.

2.5.  Update in Internationalized Electronic Mail Addresses
      (Section 7.5)

   This update aligns with IDNA2008 and [RFC8398].  Since all of
   Section 7.5 of [RFC5280] is replaced, the OLD text is not provided.

   NEW

   |  Electronic Mail addresses may be included in certificates and CRLs
   |  in the subjectAltName and issuerAltName extensions, name
   |  constraints extension, authority information access extension,
   |  subject information access extension, issuing distribution point
   |  extension, or CRL distribution points extension.  Each of these
   |  extensions uses the GeneralName construct.  If the email address
   |  includes an IDN but the local-part of the email address can be
   |  represented in ASCII, then the email address is placed in the
   |  rfc822Name choice of GeneralName, which is defined as type
   |  IA5String.  If the local-part of the internationalized email
   |  address cannot be represented in ASCII, then the internationalized
   |  email address is placed in the otherName choice of GeneralName
   |  using the conventions in RFC 8398 [RFC8398].
   |  
   |  When the host-part contains an IDN, conforming implementations
   |  MUST convert all U-labels to A-labels.
   |  
   |  7.5.1.  Local-Part Contains Only ASCII Characters
   |  
   |  Two email addresses are considered to match if:
   |  
   |  1)  The local-part of each name is an exact match, AND
   |  
   |  2)  The host-part of each name matches using a case-insensitive
   |      ASCII comparison.
   |  
   |  Implementations that have a user interface SHOULD convert the
   |  host-part of internationalized email addresses specified in these
   |  extensions to Unicode before display.  Specifically, conforming
   |  implementations convert A-labels to U-labels for display purposes.
   |  
   |  7.5.2.  Local-Part Contains Non-ASCII Characters
   |  
   |  When the local-part contains non-ASCII characters, conforming
   |  implementations MUST place the internationalized email address in
   |  the SmtpUTF8Mailbox within the otherName choice of GeneralName as
   |  specified in Section 3 of RFC 8398 [RFC8398].  Note that the UTF8
   |  encoding of the internationalized email address MUST NOT contain a
   |  Byte-Order-Mark (BOM) [RFC3629] to aid comparison.  The email
   |  address local-part within the SmtpUTF8Mailbox MUST conform to the
   |  requirements of [RFC6530] and [RFC6531].
   |  
   |  Two email addresses are considered to match if:
   |  
   |  1)  The local-part of each name is an exact match, AND
   |  
   |  2)  The host-part of each name matches using a case-insensitive
   |      ASCII comparison.
   |  
   |  Implementations that have a user interface SHOULD convert the
   |  host-part of internationalized email addresses specified in these
   |  extensions to Unicode before display.  Specifically, conforming
   |  implementations convert A-labels to U-labels for display purposes.

3.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations related to internationalized names in
   Section 4 of [RFC5890] are relevant to this specification.

   Conforming Certification Authorities (CAs) SHOULD ensure that IDNs
   are valid according to IDNA2008, which is defined in [RFC5890],
   [RFC5891], [RFC5892], [RFC5893], [RFC5894], and the updates to these
   documents.  Failure to use valid A-labels may yield a domain name
   that cannot be correctly represented in the Domain Name System (DNS).
   In addition, the CA/Browser Forum offers some guidance regarding
   internal server names in certificates [CABF].

   An earlier version of this specification [RFC8399] required
   conversion of A-labels to U-labels in order to process name
   constraints for internationalized email addresses in SmtpUTF8Mailbox
   other names.  This led to implementation complexity and at least two
   security vulnerabilities.  Now, all IDNs are carried and processed as
   A-labels.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
