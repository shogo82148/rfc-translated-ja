If another method used by SCTP already provides the\r\nsame or a higher level of data integrity, computing this checksum\r\ndoes not provide any additional protection but does consume computing\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nThis document provides a simple extension allowing SCTP to save these\r\ncomputing resources by using zero as the checksum in a\r\nbackwards-compatible way. It also defines how this feature can be\r\nused when SCTP packets are encapsulated in Datagram Transport Layer\r\nSecurity (DTLS) packets.","pub_date":"September 2024","keywords":[],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9653","errata_url":null}
