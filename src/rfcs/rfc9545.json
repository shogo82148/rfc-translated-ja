A\r\nsubset of segments from the segment list cannot be leveraged to\r\ndistinguish one SR path from another as they may be partially\r\ncongruent. SR path identification is a prerequisite for various use\r\ncases such as performance measurement and end-to-end 1+1 path\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nIn an SR over MPLS (SR-MPLS) data plane, an egress node cannot\r\ndetermine on which SR path a packet traversed the network from the\r\nlabel stack because the segment identifiers are removed from the\r\nlabel stack as the packet transits the network.\r\n\r\nThis document defines a Path Segment Identifier (PSID) to identify an\r\nSR path on the egress node of the path.","pub_date":"February 2024","keywords":["Performance Measurement","Bidirectional SR Path","End-to-End Path Protection","SR Path Segment","Path Segment"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9545","errata_url":null}
