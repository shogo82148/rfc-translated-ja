FROST signatures can be issued\r\nafter a threshold number of entities cooperate to compute a\r\nsignature, allowing for improved distribution of trust and redundancy\r\nwith respect to a secret key. FROST depends only on a prime-order\r\ngroup and cryptographic hash function. This document specifies a\r\nnumber of ciphersuites to instantiate FROST using different\r\nprime-order groups and hash functions.
