 Simple Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol Extensions for Performance
                Measurement on a Link Aggregation Group

Abstract

   This document extends Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol
   (STAMP) to implement performance measurement on every member link of
   a Link Aggregation Group (LAG).  Knowing the measured metrics of each
   member link of a LAG enables operators to enforce a performance-based
   traffic steering policy across the member links.

1.  Introduction

   A Link Aggregation Group (LAG), as defined in [IEEE802.1AX], provides
   mechanisms to combine multiple physical links into a single logical
   link.  This logical link offers higher bandwidth and better
   resiliency because, if one of the physical member links fails, the
   aggregate logical link can continue to forward traffic over the
   remaining operational physical member links.

   Usually, when forwarding traffic over a LAG, a hash-based mechanism
   is used to load balance the traffic across the LAG member links.  The
   link delay might vary between member links because of different
   transport paths, especially when a LAG is used in a wide area
   network.  To provide low-latency service for time-sensitive traffic,
   we need to explicitly steer the traffic across the LAG member links
   based on the link delay, loss, and so on.  That requires a solution
   to measure the performance metrics of each member link of a LAG.
   Hence, the measured performance metrics can work together with Layer
   2 bundle member link attributes advertisement [RFC8668] for traffic
   steering.

   According to the classifications in [RFC7799], Simple Two-way Active
   Measurement Protocol (STAMP) [RFC8762] is an active measurement
   method, and it can complement passive and hybrid methods.  It
   provides a mechanism to measure both one-way and round-trip
   performance metrics, like delay, delay variation, and packet loss.  A
   STAMP test session over the LAG can be used to measure the
   performance of a member link using a specially constructed 5-tuple.
   The session can be used to measure an average of some or all member
   links of the LAG by varying one or more elements of that 5-tuple.
   However, without the knowledge of each member link, a STAMP test
   session cannot measure the performance of every physical member link.

   This document extends STAMP to implement performance measurement on
   every member link of a LAG.  It can provide the same metrics as
   One-Way Active Measurement Protocol (OWAMP) [RFC4656] and Two-Way
   Active Measurement Protocol (TWAMP) [RFC5357] can measure, such as
   delay, jitter, and packet loss.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Micro Sessions on a LAG

   This document addresses the scenario where a LAG directly connects
   two nodes.  An example of this is in Figure 1, where the LAG
   consisting of four links connects nodes A and B.  The goal is to
   measure the performance of each link of the LAG.

                     +---+                       +---+

                     | A |-----------------------| B |
                     |   |-----------------------|   |
                     |   |-----------------------|   |
                     +---+                       +---+

                 Figure 1: Performance Measurement on a LAG

   To measure the performance metrics of every member link of a LAG,
   multiple sessions (one session for each member link) need to be
   established between the two endpoints that are connected by the LAG.
   These sessions are called "micro sessions" in the remainder of this
   document.  Although micro sessions are in fact STAMP sessions
   established on member links of a LAG, test packets of micro sessions
   MUST carry member link information for validation.

   All micro sessions of a LAG share the same Sender IP Address and
   Receiver IP Address.  As for the UDP port, the micro sessions may
   share the same Sender Port and Receiver Port pair or each micro
   session may be configured with a different Sender Port and Receiver
   Port pair.  From the operational point of view, the former is simpler
   and is RECOMMENDED.

   Test packets of a micro session MUST carry the member link
   information for validation checks.  For example, when a micro STAMP
   Session-Sender receives a reflected test packet, it checks whether
   the test packet is from the expected member link.  The member link
   information is encoded in the Micro-session ID TLV introduced in
   Section 3, which also provides a detailed description about member
   link validation.

   A micro STAMP Session-Sender MAY include the Follow-Up Telemetry TLV
   [RFC8972] to request information from the micro Session-Reflector.
   This timestamp might be important for the micro Session-Sender, as it
   improves the accuracy of network delay measurement by minimizing the
   impact of egress queuing delays on the measurement.

3.  Member Link Validation

   Test packets MUST carry member link information in the Micro-session
   ID TLV introduced in this section for validation checks.  The micro
   Session-Sender verifies whether the test packet is received from the
   expected member link.  It also verifies whether the packet is sent
   from the expected member link at the Reflector side.  The micro
   Session-Reflector verifies whether the test packet is received from
   the expected member link.

3.1.  Micro-session ID TLV

   The STAMP TLV mechanism [RFC8972] extends STAMP test packets with one
   or more optional TLVs.  This document defines the TLV Type (value 11)
   for the Micro-session ID TLV that carries the micro STAMP Session-
   Sender member link identifier and Session-Reflector member link
   identifier in the Sender Micro-session ID field and the Reflector
   Micro-session ID field, respectively.  The format of the Micro-
   session ID TLV is shown as follows:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |STAMP TLV Flags|  Type = 11    |           Length              |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |     Sender Micro-session ID   |   Reflector Micro-session ID  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                       Figure 2: Micro-session ID TLV

   Type (1 octet in length):  This field is defined to indicate this TLV
      is a Micro-session ID TLV.  Value 11 has been allocated by IANA
      (Section 5).

   Length (2 octets in length):  This field is defined to carry the
      length of the Value field in octets.  The Length field value MUST
      be 4.

   Sender Micro-session ID (2 octets in length):  This field is defined
      to carry the LAG member link identifier of the Sender side.  In
      the future, it may be used generically to cover use cases beyond
      LAGs.  The value of this field MUST be unique within a STAMP
      session at the Session-Sender.

   Reflector Micro-session ID (2 octets in length):  This field is
      defined to carry the LAG member link identifier of the Reflector
      side.  In the future, it may be used generically to cover use
      cases beyond LAGs.  The value of this field MUST be unique within
      a STAMP session at the Session-Reflector.

3.2.  Micro STAMP-Test Procedures

   The micro STAMP-Test reuses the procedures as defined in Section 4 of
   STAMP [RFC8762] with the following additions.

   The micro STAMP Session-Sender MUST send the micro STAMP-Test packets
   over the member link with which the session is associated.  The
   mapping between a micro STAMP session and the Sender/Reflector member
   link identifiers can be configured by augmenting the STAMP YANG
   [STAMP-YANG].  The detailed augmentation is not in the scope of this
   document.

   When sending a test packet, the micro STAMP Session-Sender MUST set
   the Sender Micro-session ID field with the member link identifier
   associated with the micro STAMP session.  If the Session-Sender knows
   the Reflector member link identifier, the Reflector Micro-session ID
   field MUST be set.  Otherwise, the Reflector Micro-session ID field
   MUST be zero.  The Reflector member link identifier can be obtained
   from preconfiguration or learned from data plane (e.g., the reflected
   test packet).  This document does not specify the way to obtain the
   Reflector member link identifier.

   When the micro STAMP Session-Reflector receives a test packet, if the
   Reflector Micro-session ID is not zero, the micro STAMP Session-
   Reflector MUST use the Reflector member link identifier to check
   whether it is associated with the micro STAMP session.  If the
   validation fails, the test packet MUST be discarded.  If the
   Reflector Micro-session ID is zero, it will not be verified.  If all
   validations passed, the Session-Reflector sends a reflected test
   packet to the Session-Sender.  The micro STAMP Session-Reflector MUST
   put the Sender and Reflector member link identifiers that are
   associated with the micro STAMP session in the Sender Micro-session
   ID and Reflector Micro-session ID fields, respectively.  The Sender
   member link identifier is copied from the received test packet.

   When receiving a reflected test packet, the micro Session-Sender MUST
   use the Sender Micro-session ID to validate whether the reflected
   test packet is correctly received from the expected member link.  If
   the validation fails, the test packet MUST be discarded.  The micro
   Session-Sender MUST use the Reflector Micro-session ID to validate
   the Reflector's behavior.  If the validation fails, the test packet
   MUST be discarded.

   Two modes of the STAMP Session-Reflector, stateless and stateful,
   characterize the expected behavior as described in Section 4 of STAMP
   [RFC8762].  The micro STAMP-Test also supports both stateless and
   stateful modes.  However, the micro STAMP-Test does not introduce any
   additional state to STAMP, i.e., any procedure with regard to the
   Micro-session ID is stateless.

4.  Applicability

   The micro STAMP Session-Sender sends micro Session-Sender packets
   with the Micro-session ID TLV.  The micro Session-Reflector checks
   whether a test packet is received from the member link associated
   with the correct micro STAMP session if the Reflector Micro-session
   ID field is set.  When reflecting, the micro STAMP Session-Reflector
   copies the Sender Micro-session ID from the received micro Session-
   Sender packet to the micro Session-Reflector packet and sets the
   Reflector Micro-session ID field with the member link identifier that
   is associated with the micro STAMP session.  When receiving the micro
   Session-Reflector packet, the micro Session-Sender uses the Sender
   Micro-session ID to check whether the packet is received from the
   member link associated with the correct micro STAMP session.  The
   micro Session-Sender also use the Reflector Micro-session ID to
   validate the Reflector's behavior.

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has allocated the following STAMP TLV Type for the Micro-session
   ID TLV in the "STAMP TLV Types" registry [RFC8972]:

               +=======+==================+===============+
               | Value | Description      | Reference     |
               +=======+==================+===============+
               | 11    | Micro-session ID | This Document |
               +-------+------------------+---------------+

                       Table 1: New STAMP TLV Type

6.  Security Considerations

   The STAMP extension defined in this document is intended for
   deployment in the LAG scenario where Session-Sender and Session-
   Reflector are directly connected.  As such, it's assumed that a node
   involved in a STAMP operation has previously verified the integrity
   of the LAG connection and the identity of its one-hop-away peer node.

   This document does not introduce any additional security issues, and
   the security mechanisms defined in [RFC8762] and [RFC8972] apply in
   this document.
