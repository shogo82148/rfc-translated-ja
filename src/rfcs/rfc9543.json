It defines the term \"IETF Network\r\nSlice\" to describe this type of network slice and establishes the\r\ngeneral principles of network slicing in the IETF context.\r\n\r\nThe document discusses the general framework for requesting and\r\noperating IETF Network Slices, the characteristics of an IETF Network\r\nSlice, the necessary system components and interfaces, and the\r\nmapping of abstract requests to more specific technologies.  The\r\ndocument also discusses related considerations with monitoring and\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\nThis document also provides definitions of related terms to enable\r\nconsistent usage in other IETF documents that describe or use aspects\r\nof IETF Network Slices.","pub_date":"March 2024","keywords":["Network Slicing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9543","errata_url":"https:\/\/www.rfc-editor.org\/errata\/rfc9543"}
