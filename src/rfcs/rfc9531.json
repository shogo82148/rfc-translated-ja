This specification derives directly from the design\r\npublished in \"Path Switching in Content Centric and Named Data\r\nNetworks\" (4th ACM Conference on Information-Centric Networking) and,\r\ntherefore, does not recapitulate the design motivations,\r\nimplementation details, or evaluation of the scheme.
