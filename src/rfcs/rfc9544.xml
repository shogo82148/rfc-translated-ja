   This document defines a set of metrics for networking services with
   performance requirements expressed as Service Level Objectives (SLOs).
   These metrics, referred to as "Precision Availability Metrics (PAMs)",
   are useful for defining and monitoring SLOs.
  For example, PAMs can be used by providers and/or customers of an RFC 9543 Network Slice Service
  to assess whether the service is provided in compliance with its defined SLOs.

  Service providers and users often need to assess the quality with which network services are being delivered.
  In particular, in cases where service-level guarantees are documented (including their companion metrology) as part of a
  contract established between the customer and the service provider, and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) are defined,
  it is essential to provide means to verify that what has been delivered complies with what has been possibly negotiated
  and (contractually) defined between the customer and the service provider. 
  Examples of SLOs would be target values for the maximum packet delay
  (one-way and/or round-trip) or maximum packet loss ratio that would be deemed acceptable. 
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">
More generally, SLOs can be used to characterize the ability of a particular set of nodes to communicate
according to certain measurable expectations. Those expectations can include but are not limited to aspects
such as latency, delay variation, loss, capacity/throughput, ordering, and fragmentation.
Whatever SLO parameters are chosen and whichever way service-level parameters are being measured,
Precision Availability Metrics indicate whether or not a given service has been available according to expectations at all times.
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">
 Several metrics (often documented in the IANA "Performance Metrics" registry <xref target="IANA-PM-Registry" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IANA-PM-Registry"/>
 according to <xref target="RFC8911" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8911"/> and <xref target="RFC8912" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8912"/>) can be used to characterize the service quality, expressing
 the perceived quality of delivered networking services versus their SLOs.
  Of concern is not so much the absolute service level (for example, actual latency experienced)
  but whether the service is provided in compliance with the negotiated and eventually contracted service levels.
  For instance, this may include whether the experienced packet delay falls within
  an acceptable range that has been contracted for the service.
  The specific quality of service depends on the SLO or a set thereof for a given service that is in effect.   
  Non-compliance to an SLO might result in the degradation of the quality of experience for gamers
  or even jeopardize the safety of a large geographical area.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-4">
  The same service level may be deemed acceptable for one application, while
  unacceptable for another, depending on the needs of the application. Hence,
  it is not sufficient to measure service levels per se over time; the quality
  of the service being contextually provided (e.g., with the applicable SLO in
  mind) must be also assessed.  However, at this point, there are no standard
  metrics that can be used to account for the quality with which services are
  delivered relative to their SLOs or to determine whether their SLOs are
  being met at all times.  Such metrics and the instrumentation to support
  them are essential for various purposes, including monitoring (to ensure
  that networking services are performing according to their objectives) as
  well as accounting (to maintain a record of service levels delivered, which
  is important for the monetization of such services as well as for the
  triaging of problems).
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-5">
The current state-of-the-art of metrics include, for example,
 interface metrics that can be used to obtain statistical data on traffic volume and
 behavior that can be observed at an interface <xref target="RFC2863" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC2863"/>
        <xref target="RFC8343" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8343"/>. However, they are agnostic of actual service levels and not specific to
  distinct flows.  Flow records <xref target="RFC7011" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7011"/> <xref target="RFC7012" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC7012"/> maintain statistics
 about flows, including flow volume and flow duration, but again, they
 contain very little information about service levels, let
  alone whether the service levels delivered meet their respective targets, i.e., their associated SLOs.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-6">
  This specification introduces a new set of metrics, Precision Availability Metrics (PAMs), aimed at capturing
   service levels for a flow, specifically the degree to
   which the flow complies with the SLOs that are in effect. 
   PAMs can be used to assess whether a service is provided in compliance with its defined SLOs.
   This information can be used in multiple ways, for example,
   to optimize service delivery, take timely counteractions in the event of service degradation,
   or account for the quality of services being delivered.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-7">
   Availability is discussed in <xref target="RFC7297" sectionFormat="of" section="3.4" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7297#section-3.4" derivedContent="RFC7297"/>.
   In this document, the term "availability" reflects that
   a service that is characterized by its SLOs is considered unavailable whenever those SLOs are violated,
   even if basic connectivity is still working. "Precision" refers to services
   whose service levels are governed by SLOs and must be delivered precisely
   according to the associated quality and performance requirements. It should be noted that precision
   refers to what is being assessed, not the mechanism used to measure it. In other words, 
   it does not refer to the precision of the mechanism with which actual service levels are measured. 
   Furthermore, the precision, with respect to the delivery of an SLO, particularly applies when a metric value
approaches the specified threshold levels in the SLO. 
</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-8">
The specification and implementation of methods
   that provide for accurate measurements are separate topics independent of the definition of
   the metrics in which the results of such measurements would be expressed.  
     Likewise, Service Level Expectations (SLEs), as defined in <xref target="RFC9543" sectionFormat="of" section="5.1" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9543#section-5.1" derivedContent="RFC9543"/>,

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-1">
When analyzing the availability metrics of a service between two measurement points,
a time interval as the unit of PAMs needs to be selected. In <xref target="ITU.G.826" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="ITU.G.826"/>,
a time interval of one second is used. That is reasonable, but some services may require different granularity (e.g., decamillisecond).
For that reason, the time interval in PAMs is viewed as a variable parameter, though constant for a particular measurement session.
Furthermore, for the purpose of PAMs, each time interval is classified as either Violated Interval (VI),
Severely Violated Interval (SVI), or Violation-Free Interval (VFI). These are defined as follows:
</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-3.1-2">
          <li pn="section-3.1-2.1">VI is a time interval during which at least one of the performance
      parameters degraded below its configurable optimal threshold.</li>
          <li pn="section-3.1-2.2">SVI is a time interval during which at least one of the performance
      parameters degraded below its configurable critical threshold.</li>
          <li pn="section-3.1-2.3">Consequently, VFI is a time interval during which all performance parameters are
        at or better than their respective pre-defined optimal levels.</li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-3">
      The monitoring of performance parameters to determine the quality of an interval
      is performed between the elements of the network that are identified in the SLO corresponding to the performance parameter.
      Mechanisms for setting levels of a threshold of an SLO are outside the scope of this document.
        </t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-4">
From the definitions above, a set of basic metrics can be defined that count the number of time intervals that fall into each category: 
</t>
        <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-3.1-5">
          <li pn="section-3.1-5.1">VI count </li>

          <li pn="section-3.1-5.3">VFI count </li>
        </ul>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-6">
These count metrics are essential in calculating respective ratios (see <xref target="derived-ep-metrics-section" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.2"/>)
that can be used to assess the instability of a service.
</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1-7"> Beyond accounting for violated intervals, it is sometimes beneficial to
maintain counts of packets for which a performance threshold is violated.  For
example, this allows for distinguishing between cases in which violated
intervals are caused by isolated violation occurrences (such as a sporadic
issue that may be caused by a temporary spike in a queue depth along the
packet's path) or by broad violations across multiple packets (such as a
problem with slow route convergence across the network or more foundational
issues such as insufficient network resources).  Maintaining such counts and
comparing them with the overall amount of traffic also facilitate assessing
compliance with statistical SLOs (see <xref target="statistical-slo-section" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 4"/>).  For these reasons, the following
additional metrics are defined:

        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-1">
It might be useful for a service provider to determine the current condition of the service for which
PAMs are maintained.  To facilitate this, it is conceivable to complement PAMs with a state model.
Such a state model can be used to indicate whether a service is currently considered as available or unavailable
depending on the network's recent ability to provide service without incurring intervals during which violations occur.
It is conceivable to define such a state model in which transitions occur per some predefined PAM settings.  
</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-2">
While the definition of a service state model is outside the scope of this document, this section provides
some considerations for how such a state model and accompanying configuration settings could be defined.  
</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-3">For example, a state model could be defined by a Finite State Machine featuring two states:
"available"  and "unavailable".  The initial state could be "available".  A service could subsequently be deemed as "unavailable"
based on the number of successive interval violations that have been experienced up to the particular observation time moment.
To return to a state of "available", a number of intervals without violations would need to be observed.   
</t>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-4">
The number of successive intervals with violations, as well as the
number of successive intervals that are free of violations, required
for a state to transition to another state is defined by a configuration setting.
Specifically, the following configuration parameters are defined: 
</t>
        <dl newline="false" spacing="normal" indent="3" pn="section-3.3-5">
          <dt pn="section-3.3-5.1">Unavailability threshold:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.3-5.2">The number of successive intervals during which a violation occurs to transition to an unavailable state.  </dd>
          <dt pn="section-3.3-5.3">Availability threshold:</dt>
          <dd pn="section-3.3-5.4">The number of successive intervals during which
  no violations must occur to allow transition to an available state from a
  previously unavailable state. </dd>
        </dl>
        <t indent="0" pn="section-3.3-6">
Additional configuration parameters could be defined to account for the severity of violations.  Likewise, it is conceivable to define
configuration settings that also take VIR and SVIR into account.

      <name slugifiedName="name-statistical-slo">Statistical SLO</name>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-1">
     It should be noted that certain SLAs may be
   statistical, requiring the service levels of packets in a
   flow to adhere to specific distributions.  For example, an SLA might
   state that any given SLO applies to at least a certain percentage of
   packets, allowing for a certain level of, for example, 
   packet loss and/or exceeding packet delay threshold to take place.
   Each such event, in that case, does not necessarily constitute an
   SLO violation.  However, it is still useful to maintain those
   statistics, as the number of out-of-SLO packets still matters when
   looked at in proportion to the total number of packets.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-2">
   Along that vein, an SLA might establish a multi-tiered SLO of, say, end-to-end
   latency (from the lowest to highest tier) as follows:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal" bare="false" empty="false" indent="3" pn="section-4-3">
        <li pn="section-4-3.1">not to exceed 30 ms for any packet;</li>
        <li pn="section-4-3.2">not to exceed 25 ms for 99.999% of packets; and</li>
        <li pn="section-4-3.3">not to exceed 20 ms for 99% of packets.</li>
      </ul>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-4">
  In that case, any individual packet with a latency greater than 20 ms latency
   and lower than 30 ms cannot be considered an SLO violation in itself, but compliance with
   the SLO may need to be assessed after the fact.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-4-5">
   To support statistical SLOs more directly requires
   additional metrics, for example, metrics that represent histograms for
   service-level parameters with buckets corresponding to individual
   SLOs. Although the definition of histogram metrics is outside the scope of this document 
   and could be considered for future work (see <xref target="for-discussion" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 6"/>), for the example just given, a histogram
   for a particular flow could be maintained with four buckets: one
   containing the count of packets within 20 ms, a second with a count of
   packets between 20 and 25 ms (or simply all within 25 ms), a third with
   a count of packets between 25 and 30 ms (or merely all packets within
   30 ms), and a fourth with a count of anything beyond (or simply a total
   count).  Of course, the number of buckets and the boundaries between
   those buckets should correspond to the needs of the SLA associated with the application,
   i.e., to the specific guarantees and SLOs that were
   provided.

     PAMs provide several benefits with other, more conventional performance metrics.
     Without PAMs, it would be possible to conduct ongoing measurements of service levels,
     maintain a time series of service-level records, and then assess compliance with specific
     SLOs after the fact.  However, doing so would require the collection of vast amounts of data
     that would need to be generated, exported, transmitted, collected, and stored. 
     In addition, extensive post-processing would be required to compare that data against SLOs
     and analyze its compliance.  Being able to perform these tasks at scale

   Instrumentation for metrics that are used to assess compliance with
   SLOs constitutes an attractive target for an attacker.  By interfering
   with the maintenance of such metrics, services could be falsely
   identified as complying (when they are not) or vice versa
   (i.e., flagged as being non-compliant when indeed they are).  While this
   document does not specify how networks should be instrumented to
   maintain the identified metrics, such instrumentation needs to be
   adequately secured to ensure accurate measurements and prohibit
   tampering with metrics being kept.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-2">
         Where metrics are being defined relative to an SLO, the configuration
   of those SLOs needs to be adequately secured.  Likewise, where
   SLOs can be adjusted, the correlation between any metric instance
   and a particular SLO must be unambiguous. The same service levels that constitute
   SLO violations for one flow and should be maintained as part of
   the "violated time units" and related metrics
   may be compliant for another flow.  In cases when it is
   impossible to tie together SLOs and PAMs, it is
   preferable to merely maintain statistics about service levels
   delivered (for example, overall histograms of end-to-end
   latency) without assessing which constitute violations.
      </t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-8-3">
      By the same token, the definition of what constitutes a
   "severe" or a "significant" violation depends on configuration settings or
   context. The configuration of such settings or context needs to be
   specially secured. Also, the configuration must be bound to
   the metrics being maintained.  Thus, it will be clear which configuration setting
   was in effect when those metrics were being assessed.  An attacker
   that can tamper with such configuration settings will render the
   corresponding metrics useless (in the best case) or misleading (in
   the worst case).

          <title>IP Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP)</title>

          <abstract>
            <t indent="0">This document describes the Connectivity Provisioning Profile (CPP) and proposes a CPP template to capture IP/MPLS connectivity requirements to be met within a service delivery context (e.g., Voice over IP or IP TV). The CPP defines the set of IP transfer parameters to be supported by the underlying transport network together with a reachability scope and bandwidth/capacity needs. Appropriate performance metrics, such as one-way delay or one-way delay variation, are used to characterize an IP transfer service. Both global and restricted reachability scopes can be captured in the CPP.</t>
            <t indent="0">Such a generic CPP template is meant to (1) facilitate the automation of the service negotiation and activation procedures, thus accelerating service provisioning, (2) set (traffic) objectives of Traffic Engineering functions and service management functions, and (3) improve service and network management systems with 'decision- making' capabilities based upon negotiated/offered CPPs.</t>
