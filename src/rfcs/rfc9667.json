This can be addressed by decreasing the flooding\r\ntopology so that it is less dense.\r\n\r\nThis document discusses the problem in some depth and an\r\narchitectural solution. Specific protocol changes for IS-IS, OSPFv2,\r\nand OSPFv3 are described in this document.","pub_date":"October 2024","keywords":["datacenter","IGP","routing","flooding","dense","graph","topology"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9667","errata_url":null}
