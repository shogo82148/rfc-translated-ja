Since then,\r\nadditional requirements have become known.  The present document\r\ndefines a CBOR tag for time that allows a more elaborate\r\nrepresentation of time, as well as related CBOR tags for duration and\r\ntime period.  This document is intended as the reference document for\r\nthe IANA registration of the CBOR tags defined.","pub_date":"August 2024","keywords":["Point in time","Duration","Period in time","Clock accuracy","Timescale","TAI","UTC","NTP","Network Time Protocol","PTP","Precision Time Protocol"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9581","errata_url":null}
