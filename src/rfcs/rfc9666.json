However, when lower levels are used for transit,\r\nthey must expose their internal topologies to each other, thereby\r\nleading to scaling issues. \r\n\r\nTo avoid such issues, this document discusses extensions to the IS-IS\r\nrouting protocol that allow Level 1 (L1) areas to provide transit but\r\nonly inject an abstraction of the Level 1 topology into Level 2 (L2).\r\nEach Level 1 area is represented as a single Level 2 node, thereby\r\nenabling a greater scale.","pub_date":"October 2024","keywords":["datacenter","IGP","routing","topology","level","abstraction","IS-IS","proxy"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9666","errata_url":null}
