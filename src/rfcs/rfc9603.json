The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)\r\nextension and mechanisms to support SR-MPLS have been defined. This\r\ndocument outlines the necessary extensions to support SR for the IPv6\r\ndata plane within PCEP.","pub_date":"July 2024","keywords":["PCEP","SRv6","IPv6"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9603","errata_url":null}
