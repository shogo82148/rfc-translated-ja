 Revision to Registration Procedures for IS-IS Neighbor Link-Attribute
                               Bit Values

Abstract

   RFC 5029, "Definition of an IS-IS Link Attribute Sub-TLV", defines an
   IANA registry called "IS-IS Neighbor Link-Attribute Bit Values".
   This document changes the registration procedure for that registry
   from "Standards Action" to "Expert Review".  This document updates
   RFC 5029.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5029] defines the "IS-IS Neighbor Link-Attribute Bit Values"
   registry and specifies a registration procedure of "Standards
   Action".  In practice, this registration procedure is unnecessarily
   restrictive, as it prevents allocation of bits to experimental
   protocols, which in turn increases the risk of conflicts introduced
   by use of unregistered code points (so-called "code point
   squatting").

   Accordingly, this document changes the registration procedure for the
   registry, as described in Section 2.

2.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has changed the registration procedure for the "IS-IS Neighbor
   Link-Attribute Bit Values" registry to "Expert Review" [RFC8126] and
   has listed this document as a reference for the registry.  General
   guidance for the designated experts is defined in [RFC7370], and more
   specific guidance can be found in [RFC5029].

3.  Security Considerations

   This document does not affect the security issues discussed in
   [RFC5029].
