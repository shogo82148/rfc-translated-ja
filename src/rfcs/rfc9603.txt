 Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP) Extensions for
                          IPv6 Segment Routing

Abstract

   Segment Routing (SR) can be used to steer packets through a network
   using the IPv6 or MPLS data plane, employing the source routing
   paradigm.

   An SR Path can be derived from a variety of mechanisms, including an
   IGP Shortest Path Tree (SPT), explicit configuration, or a Path
   Computation Element (PCE).

   Since SR can be applied to both MPLS and IPv6 data planes, a PCE
   should be able to compute an SR Path for both MPLS and IPv6 data
   planes.  The Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
   extension and mechanisms to support SR-MPLS have been defined.  This
   document outlines the necessary extensions to support SR for the IPv6
   data plane within PCEP.

1.  Introduction

   As defined in [RFC8402], Segment Routing (SR) architecture allows the
   source node to steer a packet through a path indicated by an ordered
   list of instructions, called "segments".  A segment can represent any
   instruction, topological or service based, and it can have a semantic
   local to an SR node or global within an SR domain.

   [RFC5440] describes Path Computation Element Communication Protocol
   (PCEP) for communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and
   a PCE or between a pair of PCEs.  A PCE or a PCC operating as a PCE
   (in a hierarchical PCE environment) computes paths for MPLS Traffic
   Engineering Label Switched Paths (MPLS-TE LSPs) based on various
   constraints and optimization criteria.

   [RFC8231] specifies extensions to PCEP that allow a stateful PCE to
   compute and recommend network paths in compliance with [RFC4657] and
   defines objects and TLVs for MPLS-TE LSPs.  Stateful PCEP extensions
   provide synchronization of LSP state between a PCC and a PCE or
   between a pair of PCEs, delegation of LSP control, reporting of LSP
   state from a PCC to a PCE, and controlling the setup and path routing
   of an LSP from a PCE to a PCC.  Stateful PCEP extensions are intended
   for an operational model in which LSPs are configured on the PCC, and
   control over them is delegated to the PCE.

   A mechanism to dynamically initiate LSPs on a PCC based on the
   requests from a stateful PCE or a controller using stateful PCE is
   specified in [RFC8281].  As per [RFC8664], it is possible to use a
   stateful PCE for computing one or more SR-TE paths taking into
   account various constraints and objective functions.  Once a path is
   computed, the stateful PCE can initiate an SR-TE path on a PCC using
   PCEP extensions specified in [RFC8281] and the SR-specific PCEP
   extensions specified in [RFC8664].

   [RFC8664] specifies PCEP extensions for supporting an SR-TE LSP for
   the MPLS data plane.  This document extends [RFC8664] to support SR
   for the IPv6 data plane.  Additionally, using procedures described in
   this document, a PCC can request an SRv6 path from either a stateful
   or stateless PCE.  This specification relies on the PATH-SETUP-TYPE
   TLV and procedures specified in [RFC8408].

   This specification provides a mechanism for a network controller
   (acting as a PCE) to instantiate candidate paths for an SR Policy
   onto a head-end node (acting as a PCC) using PCEP.  For more
   information on the SR Policy architecture, see [RFC9256], which
   applies to both SR-MPLS and SRv6.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC,
   PCE, PCEP, PCEP Peer.

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC8051]: Stateful
   PCE, Delegation.

   Further, the following terms are used in the document:

   MSD:  Maximum SID Depth

   PST:  Path Setup Type

   SR:  Segment Routing

   SID:  Segment Identifier

   SRv6:  Segment Routing over IPv6 data plane

   SRH:  IPv6 Segment Routing Header [RFC8754]

   SRv6 path:  IPv6 Segment List (A list of IPv6 SIDs representing a
      path in IPv6 SR domain in the context of this document.)

   Further, note that the term "LSP" used in the PCEP specifications
   would be equivalent to an SRv6 path (represented as a list of SRv6
   segments) in the context of supporting SRv6 in PCEP.

3.  Overview of PCEP Operation in SRv6 Networks

   Basic operations for PCEP speakers are built on [RFC8664].

   In PCEP messages, route information is carried in the Explicit Route
   Object (ERO), which consists of a sequence of subobjects.  [RFC8664]
   defined a new ERO subobject denoted by "SR-ERO subobject" that is
   capable of carrying a SID as well as the identity of the node/
   adjacency represented by the SID for SR-MPLS.  SR-capable PCEP
   speakers can generate and/or process such an ERO subobject.  An ERO
   containing SR-ERO subobjects can be included in the PCEP Path
   Computation Reply (PCRep) message defined in [RFC5440], the PCEP LSP
   Initiate Request message (PCInitiate) defined in [RFC8281], as well
   as in the PCEP LSP Update Request (PCUpd) and PCEP LSP State Report
   (PCRpt) messages defined in [RFC8231].  [RFC8664] also defines a new
   Reported Route Object (RRO), called "SR-RRO", to represent the SID
   list that was applied by the PCC, which is the actual path taken by
   the LSP in SR-MPLS network.

   The SRv6 paths computed by a PCE can be represented as an ordered
   list of SRv6 segments.  This document defines new subobjects
   "SRv6-ERO" and "SRv6-RRO" in the ERO and the RRO, respectively, to
   carry the SRv6 SID.  SRv6-capable PCEP speakers MUST be able to
   generate and/or process these subobjects.

   When a PCEP session between a PCC and a PCE is established, both PCEP
   speakers exchange their capabilities to indicate their ability to
   support SRv6-specific functionality as described in Section 4.1.1.

   In summary, this document defines:

   *  a new PCEP capability for SRv6,

   *  a new subobject SRv6-ERO in ERO,

   *  a new subobject SRv6-RRO in RRO, and

   *  a new Path Setup type (PST) [RFC8408], carried in the PATH-SETUP-
      TYPE and PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLVs.

3.1.  Operation Overview

   In SR networks, an SR source node [RFC8754] steers a packet into an
   SR Policy resulting in a segment list.

   When SR leverages the IPv6 data plane (i.e., SRv6), the PCEP
   procedures and mechanisms are extended in this document.

   This document describes the extension to support SRv6 in PCEP.  A PCC
   or PCE indicates its ability to support SRv6 during the PCEP session
   initialization phase via a new SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV (see
   details in Section 4.1.1).

3.2.  SRv6-Specific PCEP Message Extensions

   As defined in [RFC5440], a PCEP message consists of a common header
   followed by a variable-length body made up of mandatory and/or
   optional objects.  This document does not require any changes in the
   format of PCReq and PCRep messages specified in [RFC5440], the
   PCInitiate message specified in [RFC8281], or PCRpt and PCUpd
   messages specified in [RFC8231].  However, PCEP messages pertaining
   to SRv6 MUST include PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV in the Request Parameters
   (RP) or Stateful PCE Request Parameters (SRP) object to clearly
   identify that SRv6 is intended.

4.  Object Formats

4.1.  The OPEN Object

4.1.1.  The SRv6 PCE Capability sub-TLV

   This document defines a new Path Setup Type (PST) [RFC8408] for SRv6,
   as follows:

   PST=3:  Path is set up using SRv6.

   A PCEP speaker indicates its support of the function described in
   this document by sending a PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV in the OPEN
   object with this new PST (value 3) included in the PST list.

   This document also defines the SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV.  PCEP
   speakers use this sub-TLV to exchange information about their SRv6
   capability.  If a PCEP speaker includes PST=3 in the PST list of the
   PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV, then it MUST also include the SRv6-
   PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV inside the PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV.
   For further error handling, please see Section 5.

   The format of the SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV is shown in Figure 1.

                Figure 1: SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY Sub-TLV Format

   The code point for the TLV type is 27, and the format is compliant
   with the PCEP TLV format defined in [RFC5440].  That is, the sub-TLV
   is composed of 2 octets for the type, 2 octets specifying the length,
   and a Value field.  When set to 27, the Type field identifies the
   SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV, and the presence of the sub-TLV
   indicates the support for the SRv6 paths in PCEP.  The Length field
   defines the length of the value portion in octets.  The sub-TLV is
   padded to 4-octet alignment, and padding is not included in the
   Length field.  The (MSD-Type,MSD-Value) pairs are OPTIONAL.  The
   number of (MSD-Type,MSD-Value) pairs can be determined by the Length
   field of the TLV.

   The value is comprised of:

   *  Reserved: 2 octets; this field MUST be set to 0 on transmission
      and ignored on receipt.

   *  Flags: 2 octets; one bit is currently assigned in Section 8.6

      -  N bit (bit position 14): A PCC sets this flag bit to 1 to
         indicate that it is capable of resolving a Node or Adjacency
         Identifier (NAI) to an SRv6-SID.

      -  Unassigned bits MUST be set to 0 on transmission and ignored on
         receipt

   *  A pair of (MSD-Type,MSD-Value): Where MSD-Type (1 octet) is as per
      the IGP MSD Type registry created by [RFC8491] and populated with
      SRv6 MSD types as per [RFC9352], and where MSD-Value (1 octet) is
      as per [RFC8491].

   The SRv6 MSD information advertised via SRv6-PCE-Capability sub-TLV
   conveys the SRv6 capabilities of the PCEP speaker alone.  However,
   when it comes to the computation of an SR Policy for the SRv6 data
   plane, the SRv6 MSD capabilities of the intermediate SRv6 Endpoint
   node and the tail-end node also need to be considered to ensure those
   midpoints are able to correctly process their segments and for the
   tail-end to dispose of the SRv6 encapsulation.  The SRv6 MSD
   capabilities of other nodes might be learned as part of the topology
   information via the Border Gateway Protocol - Link State (BGP-LS)
   [RFC9514] or via PCEP if the PCE also happens to have PCEP sessions
   with those nodes.

   It is recommended that the SRv6 MSD information not be included in
   the SRv6-PCE-Capability sub-TLV in deployments where the PCE is able
   to obtain this via IGP/BGP-LS as part of the topology information.

4.2.  The RP/SRP Object

   This document defines a new Path Setup Type (PST=3) for SRv6.  In
   order to indicate that the path is for SRv6, any RP or SRP object
   MUST include the PATH-SETUP-TYPE TLV as specified in [RFC8408], where
   PST is set to 3.

4.3.  ERO

   In order to support SRv6, a new "SRv6-ERO" subobject is defined for
   inclusion in the ERO.

4.3.1.  SRv6-ERO Subobject

   An SRv6-ERO subobject is formatted as shown in Figure 2.

    0                   1                   2                   3

                    Figure 2: SRv6-ERO Subobject Format

   The fields in the SRv6-ERO subobject are as follows:

   *  The "L" flag: Indicates whether the subobject represents a loose
      hop (see [RFC3209]).  If this flag is set to zero, a PCC MUST NOT
      overwrite the SID value present in the SRv6-ERO subobject.
      Otherwise, a PCC MAY expand or replace one or more SID values in
      the received SRv6-ERO based on its local policy.

   *  Type: Indicates the content of the subobject, i.e., when the field
      is set to 40, the subobject is an SRv6-ERO subobject representing
      an SRv6 SID.

   *  Length: Contains the total length of the subobject in octets.  The
      Length MUST be at least 24 and MUST be a multiple of 4.  An
      SRv6-ERO subobject MUST contain at least one of an SRv6-SID or an
      NAI.  The S and F bits in the Flags field indicates whether the
      SRv6-SID or NAI fields are absent.

   *  NAI Type (NT): Indicates the type and format of the NAI contained
      in the object body, if any are present.  If the F bit is set to
      one (see below), then the NT field has no meaning and MUST be
      ignored by the receiver.  This document creates a new PCEP
      SRv6-ERO NAI Types registry in Section 8.2 and allocates the
      following values:

      -  If NT value is 0, the NAI MUST NOT be included.

      -  When NT value is 2, the NAI is as per the "IPv6 node ID" format
         defined in [RFC8664], which specifies an IPv6 address.  This is
         used to identify the owner of the SRv6 Identifier.  This is
         optional, as the LOC (the locator portion) of the SRv6 SID
         serves a similar purpose (when present).

      -  When NT value is 4, the NAI is as per the "IPv6 adjacency"
         format defined in [RFC8664], which specify a pair of IPv6
         addresses.  This is used to identify the IPv6 adjacency and
         used with the SRv6 Adj-SID.

      -  When NT value is 6, the NAI is as per the "link-local IPv6
         addresses" format defined in [RFC8664], which specify a pair of
         (global IPv6 address, interface ID) tuples.  It is used to
         identify the IPv6 adjacency and used with the SRv6 Adj-SID.

   *  Flags: Used to carry additional information pertaining to the
      SRv6-SID.  This document defines the following flag bits.  The
      other bits MUST be set to zero by the sender and MUST be ignored
      by the receiver.  This document creates a new registry SRv6-ERO
      Flag Field registry in Section 8.3 and allocates the following
      values.

      -  S: When this bit is set to 1, the SRv6-SID value in the
         subobject body is absent.  In this case, the PCC is responsible
         for choosing the SRv6-SID value, e.g., by looking up in the SR-
         DB using the NAI that, in this case, MUST be present in the
         subobject.  If the S bit is set to 1, then the F bit MUST be
         set to zero.

      -  F: When this bit is set to 1, the NAI value in the subobject
         body is absent.  The F bit MUST be set to 1 if NT=0; otherwise,
         it MUST be set to zero.  The S and F bits MUST NOT both be set
         to 1.

      -  T: When this bit is set to 1, the SID Structure value in the
         subobject body is present.  The T bit MUST be set to 0 when the
         S bit is set to 1.  If the T bit is set when the S bit is set,
         the T bit MUST be ignored.  Thus, the T bit indicates the
         presence of an optional 8-byte SID Structure when SRv6 SID is
         included.  The SID Structure is defined in Section 4.3.1.1.

      -  V: The "SID verification" bit usage is as per Section 5.1 of
         [RFC9256].  If a PCC "Verification fails" for a SID, it MUST
         report this error by including the LSP-ERROR-CODE TLV with LSP
         Error-value "SID Verification fails" in the LSP object in the
         PCRpt message to the PCE.

   *  Reserved: MUST be set to zero while sending and ignored on
      receipt.

   *  Endpoint Behavior: A 16-bit field representing the behavior
      associated with the SRv6 SIDs.  This information is optional, but
      providing it is recommended whenever possible.  It could be used
      for maintainability and diagnostic purposes.  If behavior is not
      known, value "0xFFFF" as defined in the "SRv6 Endpoint Behaviors"
      registry is used [RFC8986].

   *  SRv6 SID: SRv6 Identifier is a 128-bit value representing the SRv6
      segment.

   *  NAI: The NAI associated with the SRv6-SID.  The NAI's format
      depends on the value in the NT field and is described in
      [RFC8664].

   At least one SRv6-SID or the NAI MUST be included in the SRv6-ERO
   subobject, and both MAY be included.

4.3.1.1.  SID Structure

   The SID Structure is an optional part of the SR-ERO subobject, as
   described in Section 4.3.1.

   [RFC8986] defines an SRv6 SID as consisting of LOC:FUNCT:ARG, where a
   locator (LOC) is encoded in the L most significant bits of the SID,
   followed by F bits of function (FUNCT) and A bits of arguments (ARG).
   A locator may be represented as B:N where B is the SRv6 SID locator
   block (IPv6 prefix allocated for SRv6 SIDs by the operator) and N is
   the identifier of the parent node instantiating the SID called
   "locator node".

   The SID Structure is formatted as shown in Figure 3.

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                       Figure 3: SID Structure Format

   Where:

   *  LB Length: 1 octet; SRv6 SID Locator Block length in bits

   *  LN Length: 1 octet; SRv6 SID Locator Node length in bits

   *  Fun. Length: 1 octet; SRv6 SID Function length in bits

   *  Arg. Length: 1 octet; SRv6 SID Arguments length in bits

   The sum of all four sizes in the SID Structure must be less than or
   equal to 128 bits.  If the sum of all four sizes advertised in the
   SID Structure is larger than 128 bits, the corresponding SRv6 SID
   MUST be considered invalid and a PCErr message with Error-Type = 10
   ("Reception of an invalid object") and Error-value = 37 ("Invalid
   SRv6 SID Structure") is returned.

   *  Reserved: MUST be set to zero while sending and ignored on
      receipt.

   *  Flags: Currently no flags are defined.

   *  Unassigned bits must be set to zero while sending and ignored on
      receipt.

   The SRv6 SID Structure provides the detailed encoding information of
   an SRv6 SID, which is helpful in the use cases that require the SRv6
   SID structure to be known.  When a PCEP speaker receives the SRv6 SID
   and its structure information, the SRv6 SID can be parsed based on
   the SRv6 SID Structure and/or possible local policies.  The SRv6 SID
   Structure could be used by the PCE for ease of operations and
   monitoring.  For example, this information could be used for
   validation of SRv6 SIDs being instantiated in the network and checked
   for conformance with the SRv6 SID allocation scheme chosen by the
   operator as described in Section 3.2 of [RFC8986].  In the future,
   PCE might also be utilized to verify and automate the security of the
   SRv6 domain by provisioning filtering rules at the domain boundaries
   as described in Section 5 of [RFC8754].  The details of these
   potential applications are outside the scope of this document.

4.3.1.2.  Order of the Optional Fields

   The optional elements in the SRv6-ERO subobject, i.e., SRv6 SID, NAI,
   and the SID Structure, MUST be encoded in the order as depicted in
   Figure 2.  The presence or absence of each of them is indicated by
   the respective flags, i.e., S flag, F flag, and T flag.

   In order to ensure future compatibility, any optional elements added
   to the SRv6-ERO subobject in the future must specify their order and
   request that the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) allocate
   a flag to indicate their presence from the subregistry created in
   Section 8.3.

4.4.  RRO

   In order to support SRv6, a new "SRv6-RRO" subobject is defined for
   inclusion in the RRO.

4.4.1.  SRv6-RRO Subobject

   A PCC reports an SRv6 path to a PCE by sending a PCRpt message, per
   [RFC8231].  The RRO on this message represents the SID list that was
   applied by the PCC, that is, the actual path taken.  The procedures
   of [RFC8664] with respect to the RRO apply equally to this
   specification without change.

   An RRO contains one or more subobjects called "SRv6-RRO subobjects",
   whose format is shown in Figure 4.

    0                   1                   2                   3

                    Figure 4: SRv6-RRO Subobject Format

   The format of the SRv6-RRO subobject is the same as that of the
   SRv6-ERO subobject but without the L flag.

   The V flag has no meaning in the SRv6-RRO and is ignored on receipt
   at the PCE.

   The ordering of SRv6-RRO subobjects by PCC in PCRpt message remains
   as per [RFC8664].

   The ordering of optional elements in the SRv6-RRO subobject is the
   same as described in Section 4.3.1.2.

5.  Procedures

5.1.  Exchanging the SRv6 Capability

   A PCC indicates that it is capable of supporting the head-end
   functions for SRv6 by including the SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV in
   the Open message that it sends to a PCE.  A PCE indicates that it is
   capable of computing SRv6 paths by including the SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY
   sub-TLV in the Open message that it sends to a PCC.

   If a PCEP speaker receives a PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV with a
   PST list containing PST=3, but the SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV is
   absent, then the PCEP speaker MUST send a PCErr message with Error-
   Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid object") and Error-Value = 34
   ("Missing PCE-SRv6-CAPABILITY sub-TLV") and MUST then close the PCEP
   session.  If a PCEP speaker receives a PATH-SETUP-TYPE-CAPABILITY TLV
   with an SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV, but the PST list does not
   contain PST=3, then the PCEP speaker MUST ignore the SRv6-PCE-
   CAPABILITY sub-TLV.

   In case the MSD-Type in the SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV received by
   the PCE does not correspond to one of the SRv6 MSD types, the PCE
   MUST respond with a PCErr message (Error-Type = 1 ("PCEP session
   establishment failure") and Error-Value = 1 ("reception of an invalid
   Open message or a non Open message.")).

   Note that the (MSD-Type,MSD-Value) pair exchanged via the SRv6-PCE-
   CAPABILITY sub-TLV indicates the SRv6 SID imposition limit for the
   sender PCC node only.  However, if a PCE learns these via alternate
   mechanisms, e.g., routing protocols [RFC9352], then it ignores the
   values in the SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV.  Furthermore, whenever a
   PCE learns any other SRv6 MSD types that may be defined in the future
   via alternate mechanisms, it MUST use those values regardless of the
   values exchanged in the SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV.

   During path computation, a PCE must consider the MSD information of
   all the nodes along the path instead of only the MSD information of
   the ingress PCC since a packet may be dropped on any node in a
   forwarding path because of the SID depth exceeding the MSD of the
   node.  The MSD capabilities of all SR nodes along the path can be
   learned as part of the topology information via IGP/BGP-LS or via
   PCEP if the PCE also happens to have PCEP sessions with those nodes.

   A PCE MUST NOT send SRv6 paths that exceed the SRv6 MSD capabilities
   of the PCC.  If a PCC needs to modify the SRv6 MSD value signaled via
   the Open message, it MUST close the PCEP session and re-establish it
   with the new value.  If the PCC receives an SRv6 path that exceeds
   its SRv6 MSD capabilities, the PCC MUST send a PCErr message with
   Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid object") and Error-value =
   40 ("Unsupported number of SRv6-ERO subobjects").

   The N flag and (MSD-Type,MSD-Value) pair inside the SRv6-PCE-
   CAPABILITY sub-TLV are meaningful only in the Open message sent to a
   PCE.  As such, the flags MUST be set to zero and a (MSD-Type,MSD-
   Value) pair MUST NOT be present in the SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV in
   an Open message sent to a PCC.  Similarly, a PCC MUST ignore flags
   and any (MSD-Type,MSD-Value) pair in a received Open message.  If a
   PCE receives multiple SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLVs in an Open
   message, it processes only the first sub-TLV received.

5.2.  ERO Processing

   The processing of ERO remains unchanged in accordance with both
   [RFC5440] and [RFC8664].

5.2.1.  SRv6 ERO Validation

   If a PCC does not support the SRv6 PCE Capability and thus cannot
   recognize the SRv6-ERO or SRv6-RRO subobjects, it should respond
   according to the rules for a malformed object as described in
   [RFC5440].

   On receiving an SRv6-ERO, a PCC MUST validate that the Length field,
   the S bit, the F bit, the T bit, and the NT field are consistent, as
   follows:

   *  If NT=0, the F bit MUST be 1, the S bit MUST be zero, and the
      Length MUST be 24.

   *  If NT=2, the F bit MUST be zero.  If the S bit is 1, the Length
      MUST be 24; otherwise, the Length MUST be 40.

   *  If NT=4, the F bit MUST be zero.  If the S bit is 1, the Length
      MUST be 40; otherwise, the Length MUST be 56.

   *  If NT=6, the F bit MUST be zero.  If the S bit is 1, the Length
      MUST be 48; otherwise, the Length MUST be 64.

   *  If the T bit is 1, then the S bit MUST be zero.

   If a PCC finds that the NT field, Length field, S bit, F bit, and T
   bit are not consistent, it MUST consider the entire ERO invalid and
   MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an
   invalid object") and Error-value = 11 ("Malformed object").

   If a PCC does not recognize or support the value in the NT field, it
   MUST consider the entire ERO invalid and send a PCErr message with
   Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid object") and Error-value =
   41 ("Unsupported NAI Type in the SRv6-ERO/SRv6-RRO subobject").

   If a PCC receives an SRv6-ERO subobject in which the S and F bits are
   both set to 1 (that is, both the SID and NAI are absent), it MUST
   consider the entire ERO invalid and send a PCErr message with Error-
   Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid object") and Error-value = 42
   ("Both SID and NAI are absent in the SRv6-ERO subobject").

   If a PCC receives an SRv6-ERO subobject in which the S bit is set to
   1 and the F bit is set to zero (that is, the SID is absent and the
   NAI is present), but the PCC does not support NAI resolution, it MUST
   consider the entire ERO invalid and send a PCErr message with Error-
   Type = 4 ("Not supported object") and Error-value = 4 ("Unsupported
   parameter").

   If a PCC detects that the subobjects of an ERO are a mixture of
   SRv6-ERO subobjects and subobjects of other types, then it MUST send
   a PCErr message with Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid
   object") and Error-value = 43 ("ERO mixes SRv6-ERO subobjects with
   other subobject types").

   In case a PCEP speaker receives an SRv6-ERO subobject, when the PST
   is not set to 3 or SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV was not exchanged, it
   MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = 19 ("Invalid Operation")
   and Error-value = 19 ("Attempted SRv6 when the capability was not
   advertised").

   If a PCC receives an SRv6 path that exceeds the SRv6 MSD
   capabilities, it MUST send a PCErr message with Error-Type = 10
   ("Reception of an invalid object") and Error-value = 40 ("Unsupported
   number of SRv6-ERO subobjects") as per [RFC8664].

5.2.2.  Interpreting the SRv6-ERO

   The SRv6-ERO contains a sequence of subobjects.  According to
   [RFC9256], each SRv6-ERO subobject in the sequence identifies a
   segment that the traffic will be directed to, in the order given.
   That is, the first subobject identifies the first segment the traffic
   will be directed to, the second SRv6-ERO subobject represents the
   second segment, and so on.

5.3.  RRO Processing

   The syntax-checking rules that apply to the SRv6-RRO subobject are
   identical to those of the SRv6-ERO subobject, except as noted below.

   If a PCEP speaker receives an SRv6-RRO subobject in which both SRv6
   SID and NAI are absent, it MUST consider the entire RRO invalid and
   send a PCErr message with Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid
   object") and Error-value = 35 ("Both SID and NAI are absent in
   SRv6-RRO subobject").

   If a PCE detects that the subobjects of an RRO are a mixture of
   SRv6-RRO subobjects and subobjects of other types, then it MUST send
   a PCErr message with Error-Type = 10 ("Reception of an invalid
   object") and Error-value = 36 ("RRO mixes SRv6-RRO subobjects with
   other subobject types").

   The mechanism by which the PCC learns the path is outside the scope
   of this document.

6.  Security Considerations

   The Security Considerations described in [RFC5440], Section 2.5 of
   [RFC6952], [RFC8231], [RFC8281], [RFC8253], and [RFC8664] are
   applicable to this specification.

   Note that this specification enables a network controller to
   instantiate an SRv6 path in the network.  This creates an additional
   vulnerability if the security mechanisms of [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and
   [RFC8281] are not used.  If there is no integrity protection on the
   session, then an attacker could create an SRv6 path that may not be
   subjected to the further verification checks.  Further, the MSD field
   in the Open message could disclose node forwarding capabilities if
   suitable security mechanisms are not in place.  Hence, securing the
   PCEP session using Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC8253] is
   RECOMMENDED.

7.  Manageability Considerations

   All manageability requirements and considerations listed in
   [RFC5440], [RFC8231], [RFC8281], and [RFC8664] apply to PCEP protocol
   extensions defined in this document.  In addition, requirements and
   considerations listed in this section apply.

7.1.  Control of Function and Policy

   A PCEP implementation SHOULD allow the operator to configure the SRv6
   capability.  Further, a policy to accept NAI only for the SRv6 SHOULD
   be allowed to be set.

7.2.  Information and Data Models

   The PCEP YANG module is out of the scope of this document; it is
   defined in other documents, for example, [PCEP-YANG].  An augmented
   YANG module for SRv6 is also specified in [PCEP-SRv6-YANG] that
   allows for SRv6 capability and MSD configurations as well as to
   monitor the SRv6 paths set in the network.

7.3.  Liveness Detection and Monitoring

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new liveness
   detection and monitoring requirements in addition to those already
   listed in [RFC5440].

7.4.  Verify Correct Operations

   Verification of the mechanisms defined in this document can be built
   on those already listed in [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and [RFC8664].

7.5.  Requirements on Other Protocols

   Mechanisms defined in this document do not imply any new requirements
   on other protocols.

7.6.  Impact on Network Operations

   Mechanisms defined in [RFC5440], [RFC8231], and [RFC8664] also apply
   to PCEP extensions defined in this document.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  PCEP ERO and RRO Subobjects

   This document defines a new subobject type for the PCEP Explicit
   Route Object (ERO) and a new subobject type for the PCEP Reported
   Route Object (RRO).  These have been registered in the "Resource
   Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Parameters" registry group as shown
   below.

   IANA has allocated the following new subobject in the "Subobject type

8.2.  New SRv6-ERO NAI Type Registry

   IANA has created the "PCEP SRv6-ERO NAI Types" registry within the
   "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry group to
   manage the 4-bit NT field in the SRv6-ERO subobject.  The
   registration policy is IETF Review [RFC8126].  IANA has registered

   Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry group to manage
   the 12-bit Flag field of the SRv6-ERO subobject.  New values are to
   be assigned by Standards Action [RFC8126].  Each registration should
   include the following information:

   "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry group to
   manage the 16-bit Flag field of the SRv6-PCE-CAPABILITY sub-TLV.  New
   values are to be assigned by Standards Action [RFC8126].  Each
   registration should include the following information:

   *  Bit (counting from bit 0 as the most significant bit)

   *  Description

   *  Reference

   The following value is defined in this document.

            +=====+==============================+===========+
            | Bit | Description                  | Reference |
            +=====+==============================+===========+
            | 14  | Node or Adjacency Identifier | RFC 9603  |

            +-----+------------------------------+-----------+

                                 Table 7

8.7.  New Path Setup Type

   [RFC8408] created the "PCEP Path Setup Types" registry within the
   "Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP) Numbers" registry group.
   IANA has allocated the following value:

             +=======+==========================+===========+
             | Value | Description              | Reference |
             +=======+==========================+===========+
