   An Update to the tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export (IPFIX)
                          Information Element

Abstract

   RFC 7125 revised the tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export
   (IPFIX) Information Element that was originally defined in RFC 5102
   to reflect changes to the TCP header control bits since RFC 793.
   However, that update is still problematic for interoperability
   because some flag values have subsequently been deprecated.

   This document removes stale information from the IANA "IPFIX
   Information Elements" registry and avoids future conflicts with the
   authoritative IANA "TCP Header Flags" registry.

   This document obsoletes RFC 7125.

1.  Introduction

   TCP defines a set of control bits (also known as "flags") for
   managing connections (Section 3.1 of [RFC9293]).  The "TCP Header
   Flags" registry was initially set by [RFC3168], but it was populated
   with only TCP control bits that were defined in [RFC3168].  [RFC9293]
   fixed that by moving that registry to be listed as a subregistry
   under the "Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) Parameters" registry
   [TCP-FLAGS], adding bits that had previously been specified in
   [RFC0793], and removing the NS (Nonce Sum) bit per [RFC8311].  Also,
   Section 6 of [RFC9293] introduces "Bit Offset" to ease referencing
   each header flag's offset within the 16-bit aligned view of the TCP
   header (Figure 1 of [RFC9293]).  [TCP-FLAGS] is thus settled as the
   authoritative reference for the assigned TCP control bits.

      Note: The bits in offsets 0 through 3 are not header flags, but
      the TCP segment Data Offset field.

   [RFC7125] revised the tcpControlBits IP Flow Information Export
   (IPFIX) Information Element that was originally defined in [RFC5102]
   to reflect changes to the TCP control bits since [RFC0793].  However,
   that update is still problematic for interoperability because a value
   was deprecated since then (Section 7 of [RFC8311]), and, therefore,
   [RFC7125] risks deviating from the authoritative "TCP Header Flags"
   registry [TCP-FLAGS].

   This document fixes that problem by removing stale information from
   the "IPFIX Information Elements" registry [IPFIX] and avoiding future
   conflicts with the authoritative "TCP Header Flags" registry
   [TCP-FLAGS].  The update in this document also enhances
   observability.  For example, network operators can identify packets
   that are observed with unassigned TCP flags set and, therefore,
   identify which applications in the network should be upgraded to
   reflect the changes to TCP flags that were introduced, e.g., in
   [RFC8311].

   The main changes from [RFC7125] are listed in Appendix A.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terms defined in Section 2 of [RFC7011].

3.  Revised tcpControlBits Information Element

   ElementID:  6

   Name:  tcpControlBits

   Abstract Data Type:  unsigned16

   Data Type Semantics:  flags

   Status:  current

   Description:  TCP control bits observed for the packets of this Flow.
      This information is encoded as a bit field; each TCP control bit
      has a corresponding bit in that field.  A bit is set to 1 if any
      observed packet of this Flow has the corresponding TCP control bit
      set to 1.  The bit is cleared to 0 otherwise.

      Per [RFC9293], the assignment of TCP control bits is managed by
      IANA via the "TCP Header Flags" registry [TCP-FLAGS].
      Implementers can retrieve the current TCP control bits from that
      registry, which is authoritative for them.

      As the most significant 4 bits of octets 12 and 13 (counting from
      zero) of the TCP header [RFC9293] are used to encode the TCP data
      offset (header length), the corresponding bits in this Information
      Element MUST be reported by the Exporter with a value of zero and
      MUST be ignored by the Collector.  Use the tcpHeaderLength
      Information Element to encode this value.

      All TCP control bits (including those unassigned) MUST be exported
      as observed in the TCP headers of the packets of this Flow.

      If exported as a single octet with reduced-size encoding
      (Section 6.2 of [RFC7011]), this Information Element covers the
      low-order octet of this field (i.e., bit offset positions 8 to 15)
      [TCP-FLAGS].  A Collector receiving this Information Element with
      reduced-size encoding must not assume anything about the content
      of the four bits with bit offset positions 4 to 7.

      Exporting Processes exporting this Information Element on behalf
      of a Metering Process that is not capable of observing any of the
      flags with bit offset positions 4 to 7 SHOULD use reduced-size
      encoding, and only export the least significant 8 bits of this
      Information Element.

      Note that previous revisions of this Information Element's
      definition specified that flags with bit offset positions 8 and 9
      must be exported as zero, even if observed.  Collectors should
      therefore not assume that a value of zero for these bits in this
      Information Element indicates the bits were never set in the
      observed traffic, especially if these bits are zero in every Flow
      Record sent by a given Exporter.

      Note also that the "TCP Header Flags" registry [TCP-FLAGS] indexes
      the bit offset from the most significant bit of octet 12 to the
      least significant bit of octet 13 in the TCP header, but the
      tcpControlBits is encoded as a regular unsigned 16-bit integer.

   Units:

   Range:

   Additional Information:  See the assigned TCP control bits in the
      "TCP Header Flags" registry [TCP-FLAGS].

   Reference:  [RFC9293], RFC 9565

   Revision:  2

4.  An Example

   Figure 1 shows an example of a tcpControlBits Information Element set
   to 0x92, where MSB indicates the most significant bit and LSB
   indicates the least significant bit.  This Information Element is
   used to report TCP control bits for a Flow that has CWR (Congestion
   Window Reduced), ACK, and SYN flag bits set (that is, bit offset
   positions 8, 11, and 14).

                     MSB                           LSB
                                          1
                      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                     |0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|0|1|0|
                     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

5.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has updated the "tcpControlBits" entry of the "IPFIX Information
   Elements" registry [IPFIX] to echo the details provided in Section 3.

6.  Security Considerations

   Because the setting of TCP control bits may be misused in some Flows
   (e.g., Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks), an Exporter has
   to report all observed control bits even if no meaning is associated
   with a given TCP flag.  This document uses a stronger requirements
   language compared to [RFC7125].

   This document does not add new security considerations to those
   already discussed for IPFIX in [RFC7011].

Appendix A.  Changes from RFC 7125

   *  Cleaned up the description of the tcpControlBits Information
      Element by removing mentions of stale flag bits, referring to the
      flag bits by their bit offset position, and relying upon the IANA
      "TCP Header Flags" registry.

   *  Removed the table of TCP flag bits from the description of the
      tcpControlBits Information Element.

   *  Added the reference [TCP-FLAGS] to the Additional Information
      field of the tcpControlBits Information Element.

   *  Used strong normative language for exporting observed flags.

   *  Updated the references of the tcpControlBits Information Element.

   *  Bumped the revision of the tcpControlBits Information Element.

   *  Replaced obsolete RFCs (e.g., [RFC0793]).

   *  Added an example section (Section 4).
