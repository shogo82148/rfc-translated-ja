These include time sensitivity, data volume, connectivity\r\ncost, operation in the face of intermittent services, privacy, and\r\nsecurity. As a result, IoT is driving the Internet toward edge\r\ncomputing. This document outlines the requirements of the emerging\r\nIoT edge and its challenges. It presents a general model and major\r\ncomponents of the IoT edge to provide a common basis for future\r\ndiscussions in the Thing-to-Thing Research Group (T2TRG) and other\r\nIRTF and IETF groups.
