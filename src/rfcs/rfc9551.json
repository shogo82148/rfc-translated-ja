This document's primary purpose is to detail the specific\r\nrequirements of the Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM)\r\nrecommended to maintain a deterministic network. The document will be\r\nused in future work that defines the applicability of and extension\r\nof OAM protocols for a deterministic network.  With the\r\nimplementation of the OAM framework in DetNet, an operator will have\r\na real-time view of the network infrastructure regarding the\r\nnetwork's ability to respect the Service Level Objective (SLO), such\r\nas packet delay, delay variation, and packet-loss ratio, assigned to\r\neach DetNet flow.","pub_date":"March 2024","keywords":["Metrics","Tracing"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9551","errata_url":null}
