                 vCard Format Extensions for JSContact

Abstract

   This document defines a set of new properties for vCard and extends
   the use of existing ones.  Their primary purpose is to align the same
   set of features between the JSContact and vCard formats, but the new
   definitions also aim to be useful within just the vCard format.  This
   document updates RFC 6350 ("vCard Format Specification").

1.  Introduction

   The JSContact [RFC9553] format aims to be an alternative to the vCard
   [RFC6350] format for representation of contact and address book data.
   As such, it introduces new semantics that are not covered in the
   current definition of vCard and its various extensions.  Converting
   contact data between the two formats is defined in [RFC9555] with the
   goal of not losing any semantics during conversion.  To achieve this,
   this document defines a new set of properties for vCard and extends
   existing definitions.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  ABNF Notations

   The ABNF definitions in this document use the notations of [RFC5234].
   ABNF rules not defined in this document are defined in either
   [RFC5234] (such as the ABNF for CRLF, WSP, DQUOTE, VCHAR, ALPHA, and
   DIGIT) or [RFC6350].

2.  Updated Properties

2.1.  ADR

   This specification modifies the definition of the ADR property.  It
   extends its structured value with additional address components to
   better support the variety of international addresses.  It separates
   the address parts, which currently are typically combined in street
   address component values, into distinct components.

   Implementations SHOULD write a combined value of these components in
   the street address component for backwards compatibility, but they
   SHOULD ignore the street component during reads if the ADR property
   value contains any of the new components.

   The following change is made to the first paragraph under "Special
   note", as originally specified in Section 6.3.1 of [RFC6350].  The
   remaining paragraphs of that section in the original specification
   still apply.

   Special note: The structured type value consists of a sequence of
   address components.  The component values MUST be specified in their
   corresponding position.  The structured type value corresponds, in
   sequence, to the

      post office box;
      extended address (e.g., apartment or suite number);
      street address;
      locality (e.g., city);
      region (e.g., state or province);
      postal code;
      country name (full name in the language specified in Section 5.1
      of [RFC6350]);
      room, suite number, or identifier;
      apartment number, extension designation, or box number;
      building floor or level;
      street number;
      street name;
      building, tower, or condominium;
      block name or number;
      subdistrict;
      district;
      landmark or another publicly known prominent feature that can
      substitute the street name and number (e.g., "White House" and
      "Taj Mahal"); and
      the cardinal direction or quadrant (e.g., "north").

   The following change is made to the definition of "ADR-value" under
   "ABNF", as originally specified in Section 6.3.1 of [RFC6350].

   ABNF

   ADR-value = ; defined in RFC 6350, Section 6.3.1.:
               ADR-component-pobox ";"
               ADR-component-ext ";"
               ADR-component-street ";"
               ADR-component-locality ";"
               ADR-component-region ";"
               ADR-component-code ";"
               ADR-component-country ";"
               ; defined in this document:
               ADR-component-room ";"
               ADR-component-apartment ";"
               ADR-component-floor ";"
               ADR-component-streetnumber ";"
               ADR-component-streetname ";"
               ADR-component-building ";"
               ADR-component-block ";"
               ADR-component-subdistrict ";"
               ADR-component-district ";"
               ADR-component-landmark ";"
               ADR-component-direction

   ADR-component-pobox    = list-component
   ADR-component-ext      = list-component
   ADR-component-street   = list-component
   ADR-component-locality = list-component
   ADR-component-region   = list-component
   ADR-component-code     = list-component
   ADR-component-country  = list-component
   ADR-component-room     = list-component
   ADR-component-apartment = list-component
   ADR-component-floor    = list-component
   ADR-component-streetnumber = list-component
   ADR-component-streetname = list-component
   ADR-component-building = list-component
   ADR-component-block    = list-component
   ADR-component-subdistrict = list-component
   ADR-component-district = list-component
   ADR-component-landmark = list-component
   ADR-component-direction = list-component

   The following change is made under "Example", as originally specified
   in Section 6.3.1 of [RFC6350].

   Example: In this example, the post office box and the extended
   address components are absent.  The street number and name are both
   added as separate components and are combined in the street component
   for backwards compatibility.

   ADR;GEO="geo:12.3457,78.910":
     ;;123 Main Street;Any Town;CA;91921-1234;U.S.A
     ;;;;123;Main Street;;;;;;

2.2.  N

   This specification modifies the definition of the N property.  It
   extends its structured value with additional name components to
   better support international names and generation markers.  In doing
   so, this also facilitates formatting N property values using the
   Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) Person Name
   [CLDRPersonName] formatting standard.

   One new component is for secondary surnames, because in some
   cultures, such secondary surname kinds are used to indicate the
   paternal and maternal family names or generational names indicating
   father or grandfather.  Another new component indicates a generation
   ("II", "XVI") or parental relation ("Jr.", "Sr.").

   Currently, implementations typically place secondary surnames in the
   family name component and generational markers in the honorific
   suffixes component.  For backwards compatibility, implementations
   SHOULD add such values to both the newly defined components and their
   backwards-compatible counterpart.  Reading N property values,
   implementations SHOULD ignore any value in the backwards-compatible
   component if an equal value is set in the new component accordingly.
   For example, a "Jr." that occurs in both honorific suffixes and
   generation should only be handled as a generational marker.

   The following change is made to the first paragraph under "Special
   note", as originally specified in Section 6.2.2 of [RFC6350].  The
   remaining paragraphs of that section in the original specification
   still apply.

   Special note: The structured property value corresponds, in sequence,
   to the

      family names (also known as surnames);
      given names;
      additional names;
      honorific prefixes;
      honorific suffixes;
      secondary surname; and
      generation.

   The following change is made under "ABNF", as originally specified in
   Section 6.2.2 of [RFC6350].

   ABNF

   N-param = "VALUE=text" / sort-as-param / language-param
                / altid-param / any-param
   N-value = list-component 6(";" list-component)

   The following change is made under "Examples", as originally
   specified in Section 6.2.2 of [RFC6350].

   Examples

   N:Public;John;Quinlan;Mr.;Esq.

   N:Stevenson;John;Philip,Paul;Dr.;Jr.,M.D.,A.C.P.;;Jr.

   No change is required for the definition of the SORT-AS parameter,
   but the new components also apply for use with this parameter.

3.  New Properties

3.1.  CREATED

   Property name:  CREATED

   Purpose:  Defines the date and time when the vCard was created.

   Value type:  A single timestamp value.

   Cardinality:  *1

   Property parameters:  VALUE

   Description:  This is the timestamp when the vCard was created.
      Copying the vCard across systems does not count as a new creation
      nor a new revision.  Instead, the timestamp value typically stays
      unchanged for the existence of the vCard.

   Format definition:
      created       = "CREATED" createdparam ":" timestamp

      createdparam  = *(
                       ;
                       ; The following are OPTIONAL
                       ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                       ;
                       (";" "VALUE" "=" "timestamp") /
                       ;
                       ; The following are OPTIONAL
                       ; and MAY occur more than once.
                       ;
                       (";" any-param)
                       ;
                       )

   Example(s):
      CREATED:20220705T093412Z
      CREATED;VALUE=TIMESTAMP:20211022T140000-05

3.2.  GRAMGENDER

   Property name:  GRAMGENDER

   Purpose:  Defines which grammatical gender to use in salutations and
      other grammatical constructs.

   Value type:  A single text value that is restricted to an enumerated
      list of allowed values.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  LANGUAGE

   Description:  This property defines the grammatical gender that the
      contact prefers to be addressed by or referred to as in written or
      spoken form.  For example, the German language distinguishes by
      grammatical gender in salutations such as "Sehr geehrte"
      (feminine) and "Sehr geehrter" (masculine).  Multiple occurrences
      of this property MUST be distinguished by the LANGUAGE parameter.

   Format definition:
      gramgender       = "GRAMGENDER" gramgender-param
                            ":" gramgender-value

      gramgender-param =
                      *(
                       ;
                       ; The following are OPTIONAL
                       ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                       ;
                       (";" language-param) /
                       ;
                       ; The following are OPTIONAL
                       ; and MAY occur more than once.
                       ;
                       (";" any-param)
                       ;
                       )

      gramgender-value = "animate" /
                         "common" /
                         "feminine" /
                         "inanimate" /
                         "masculine" /
                         "neuter" /
                         iana-token /
                         x-name

   Example(s):
      GRAMGENDER;LANGUAGE=de:feminine

3.3.  LANGUAGE

   Property name:  LANGUAGE

   Purpose:  Defines the default language that human-readable text
      values in this vCard are assumed to be written in.

   Value type:  A single Language-Tag value as defined in Section 4 of
      [RFC6350].

   Cardinality:  *1

   Property parameters:  The LANGUAGE parameter MUST NOT be assigned to
      this property.

   Description:  This property defines the language that property values
      of type TEXT are assumed to be written in for this vCard.  If a
      vCard property includes the LANGUAGE parameter, then the parameter
      value has higher precedence than the LANGUAGE property value.

   Format definition:
      language-prop       = "LANGUAGE" any-param ":" Language-Tag
                     ; Language-Tag is defined in RFC 6350, Section 4.

   Example(s):
      LANGUAGE:de-AT

3.4.  PRONOUNS

   Property name:  PRONOUNS

   Purpose:  Defines the pronouns that shall be used to refer to the
      entity represented by this vCard.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  LANGUAGE, PREF, TYPE, ALTID

   Description:  This property contains the pronouns that the contact
      chooses to use for themselves.  The value is free-form text.
      These pronouns shall be used when addressing or referring to the
      contact.  Multiple occurrences of this property MAY define
      pronouns for multiple languages, preferences, and contexts.
      Multiple pronouns in the same language SHOULD use the PREF
      parameter; otherwise, the order of preference is implementation-
      specific.

   Format definition:
      pronouns       = "PRONOUNS" pronouns-param ":" text

      pronouns-param =
                      *(
                       ;
                       ; The following are OPTIONAL
                       ; but MUST NOT occur more than once.
                       ;
                       (";" language-param) /
                       (";" pref-param) /
                       (";" type-param) /
                       (";" altid-param) /
                       ;
                       ; The following are OPTIONAL
                       ; and MAY occur more than once.
                       ;
                       (";" any-param)
                       ;
                       )

   Example(s):
      PRONOUNS;LANGUAGE=en;PREF=1:xe/xir
      PRONOUNS;LANGUAGE=en;PREF=2:they/them

3.5.  SOCIALPROFILE

   Property name:  SOCIALPROFILE

   Purpose:  Specifies the URI or username for social media profiles
      associated with the object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single URI or TEXT value.  The default value type is
      URI.

   Cardinality:  *

   Property parameters:  The SERVICE-TYPE parameter MUST be assigned to
      this property if the value type is TEXT, and it MAY be assigned if
      the value type is URI.  In either case, it MUST NOT be assigned
      more than once.

   Description:  Several vCard address book implementations currently
      use an experimental X-SOCIALPROFILE property to store social media
      profiles for contacts.  This specification provides an IANA-
      registered property for the same purpose.  In addition to the
      typical use of this property with URI values, it also allows
      setting usernames for social media services as free-text TEXT
      values, in which case the service name MUST be provided as a
      parameter.  Names MUST be considered equal if they match case-
      insensitively.

   Format definition:
      socialpr       = "SOCIALPROFILE" socialpr-param ":"
                                       socialpr-value

      socialpr-param = "VALUE=uri" / "VALUE=text" /
                       service-type-param / any-param

      socialpr-value = URI / text

   Example(s):
      SOCIALPROFILE;SERVICE-TYPE=Mastodon:https://example.com/@foo
      SOCIALPROFILE:https://example.com/ietf
      SOCIALPROFILE;SERVICE-TYPE=SomeSite;VALUE=text:peter94

4.  New Parameters

4.1.  AUTHOR

   Parameter name:  AUTHOR

   Purpose:  Identifies the author of the associated property value.

   Description:  This parameter MAY be set on any property where
      conveying authorship is desired.  It identifies the author as a
      URI [RFC3986].  Since every valid URI includes the COLON (U+003A)
      character, the parameter value MUST be quoted.  As an alternative
      or in addition to this parameter, the AUTHOR-NAME parameter allows
      naming an author as a free-text value (see Section 4.2).

   Format definition:
      author-param    = "AUTHOR" "=" DQUOTE URI DQUOTE

   Example(s):
      NOTE;AUTHOR="mailto:john@example.com":This is some note.

4.2.  AUTHOR-NAME

   Parameter name:  AUTHOR-NAME

   Purpose:  Names the author of the associated property value.

   Description:  This parameter MAY be set on any property where
      conveying authorship is desired.  It names the author as a free-
      text value.  The parameter value MUST NOT be empty.
      Implementations MUST take care to quote the name part; if
      otherwise, the part will not be a valid "param-value" (see
      Section 3.3 of [RFC6350]).  As an alternative or in addition to
      this parameter, the AUTHOR parameter allows identifying an author
      by URI (see Section 4.1).

   Format definition:
      author-name-param    = "AUTHOR-NAME" "=" param-value ; not empty

   Example(s):
      NOTE;AUTHOR-NAME=John Doe:This is some note.
      NOTE;AUTHOR-NAME="_:l33tHckr:_":A note by an unusual author name.

4.3.  CREATED

   Parameter name:  CREATED

   Purpose:  Defines the date and time when a property was created in a
      vCard.

   Description:  This parameter MAY be set on any property to define the
      point in time when the property was created.  The value MUST be a
      valid TIMESTAMP value as defined in Section 4.3.5 of [RFC6350].
      Generally, updating a property value SHOULD NOT change the
      creation timestamp.

   Format definition:
      created-param = "CREATED" "=" param-value
                   ; a valid TIMESTAMP of Section 4.3.5 of RFC 6350

   Example(s):
      NOTE;CREATED=20221122T151823Z:This is some note.

4.4.  DERIVED

   Parameter name:  DERIVED

   Purpose:  Specifies that the value of the associated property is
      derived from some other property values in the same vCard.

   Description:  This property parameter SHOULD be specified on a
      property if the property value is derived from some other
      properties in the same vCard.  When present with a value of
      "true", clients MUST NOT update the property.

      As an example, an implementation may derive the value of the FN
      property from the name components of the N property.  It indicates
      this fact by setting the DERIVED parameter on the FN property to
      "true".

   Format definition:
      derived-param    = "DERIVED" "=" ("true" / "false")
      ; Default is false

   Example(s):
      N:;John;Quinlan;Mr.;
      FN;DERIVED=TRUE:Mr. John Quinlan

4.5.  LABEL

   Parameter name:  LABEL

   Purpose:  Used with the ADR property.  Its value contains a formatted
      text representation of that address, e.g., for delivery.

   Description:  Section 6.3.1 of [RFC6350] defines the ADR property,
      noting that the property can also include a LABEL parameter to
      present a delivery address label for the address.  But this
      parameter was not included in the IANA "vCard Parameters" registry
      (Section 10.3.2 of [RFC6350]) and, accordingly, is not a
      registered standard vCard element.  This specification defines and
      registers the LABEL parameter for use with the ADR property as
      originally intended.

   Format definition:
      label-param    = "LABEL" "=" param-value

   Example(s):  The LABEL parameter as illustrated in the ADR property
      example in Section 6.3.1 of [RFC6350].

      ADR;LABEL="Mr. John Q. Public, Esq.\nMail Drop: TNE QB\n123
        Main Street\nAny Town, CA  91921-1234\nU.S.A.":
        ;;123 Main Street;Any Town;CA;91921-1234;U.S.A.

4.6.  PHONETIC

   Parameter name:  PHONETIC

   Purpose:  Defines how to pronounce the value of another property in
      the same vCard.

   Description:  This property parameter indicates that the value of its
      property contains the phonetic representation of another same-
      named property in the same vCard.  Exemplary uses are defining how
      to pronounce Japanese names and romanizing Mandarin or Cantonese
      names and address components.

      The parameter value indicates the phonetic system and MUST be one
      of the values enumerated in the IANA "vCard Parameter Values"
      registry (Section 7.4).  This specification defines the following
      values:

      "ipa":  denotes the International Phonetic Alphabet [IPA].

      "jyut":  denotes the Cantonese romanization system "Jyutping".

      "piny":  denotes the Standard Mandarin romanization system "Hanyu
         Pinyin".

      "script":  denotes the unknown phonetic system.  The SCRIPT
         (Section 4.8) parameter MUST be set in addition to the PHONETIC
         parameter.

      The value type of the property on which the PHONETIC parameter is
      set MUST be of the same type as its related property.  If a
      component value is set in the property on which the PHONETIC
      parameter is set, then a component value also MUST be set at that
      same position in the related property.  On the other hand, not
      every component value in the related property needs to have a
      phonetic representation.

      The ALTID (Section 5.4 of [RFC6350]) parameter MUST be set with
      equal values on both the related property and the property having
      the PHONETIC parameter set.  If more than one same-named property
      has both the PHONETIC parameter set and an equal ALTID parameter
      value, then at most, one of these properties MAY not have the
      LANGUAGE parameter set, and all others MUST have the LANGUAGE
      parameter set.  The LANGUAGE parameters MUST NOT have equal
      values.  The LANGUAGE parameter value SHOULD NOT contain a script
      subtag in its Language-Tag value, and any such subtag MUST be
      ignored in favor of the SCRIPT (Section 4.8) parameter value.

      This specification defines the PHONETIC parameter for use with the
      ADR and N properties.

   Format definition:
      phonetic-param = "PHONETIC=" phonetic-value

      phonetic-value = "ipa" / "piny" / "jyut" / "script" /
                       iana-token / x-name

   Example(s):
      N;ALTID=1;LANGUAGE=zh-Hant:孫;中山;文,逸仙;;;;
      N;ALTID=1;PHONETIC=jyut;
        SCRIPT=Latn;LANGUAGE=yue:syun1;zung1saan1;man4,jat6sin1;;;;

4.7.  PROP-ID

   Parameter name:  PROP-ID

   Purpose:  Identifies a property among all its siblings of the same
      property name.

   Description:  This parameter uniquely identifies a property among all
      of its siblings with the same name within a vCard.  A valid PROP-
      ID value must be of 1 and a maximum of 255 octets in size, and it
      MUST only contain the ASCII alphanumeric characters ("A-Za-z0-9"),
      hyphen (-), and underscore ("_").  The identifier's only purpose
      is to uniquely identify siblings; its value has no other meaning.
      If an application makes use of PROP-ID, it SHOULD assign a unique
      identifier to each sibling property of the same name within their
      embedding component.  The same identifier MAY be used for
      properties of a different name, and it MAY also be assigned to a
      same-named property that is not a sibling.

      Resolving duplicate identifier conflicts is specific to the
      application.  Similarly, handling properties where some but not
      all siblings have a PROP-ID assigned is application-specific.

   Format definition:
      prop-id-param  = "PROP-ID" "=" 1*255(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-"/ "_")

   Example(s):
      PHOTO;PROP-ID=p827:data:image/jpeg;base64,MIICajCCAdOgAwIBAg
              <...remainder of base64-encoded data...>

4.8.  SCRIPT

   Parameter name:  SCRIPT

   Purpose:  Defines the script that a property value is written in.

   Description:  This parameter allows defining a script for a property
      value without also defining a language as the LANGUAGE parameter
      would.  The value MUST be a script subtag as defined in
      Section 2.2.3 of [RFC5646].  This specification makes use of the
      SCRIPT parameter in combination with the PHONETIC (Section 4.6)
      parameter.

   Format definition:
      script-param = 4ALPHA

   Example(s):
      SCRIPT=Latn

4.9.  SERVICE-TYPE

   Parameter name:  SERVICE-TYPE

   Purpose:  Defines the online service name associated with a messaging
      or social media profile.

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on an Instant Messaging
      and Presence Protocol (IMPP) or a SOCIALPROFILE property to name
      the online service associated with that property value.  Its value
      is case-sensitive; its letter cases MUST be preserved.

      Several vCard address book implementations currently use an
      experimental X-SERVICE-TYPE parameter.  This specification
      provides an IANA-registered parameter for the same purpose.

   Format definition:
      service-type-param    = "SERVICE-TYPE" "=" param-value

   Example(s):
      SOCIALPROFILE;SERVICE-TYPE=Mastodon:https://example.com/@foo

4.10.  USERNAME

   Parameter name:  USERNAME

   Purpose:  Defines a username such as the user of a messaging or
      social media service.

   Description:  This parameter MAY be specified on an IMPP or a
      SOCIALPROFILE property to name the user with that property value.
      Its value is case-sensitive; its letter cases MUST be preserved.
      The IMPP or SOCIALPROFILE value type MUST be URI.

   Format definition:
      username-param    = "USERNAME" "=" param-value

   Example(s):
      SOCIALPROFILE;USERNAME="The Foo":https://example.com/@foo

5.  New Values

5.1.  Billing Address Type Value

   Value:  billing

   Purpose:  Indicates using this address for billing, e.g., to send
      invoices to.

   Conformance:  This value can be used with the TYPE parameter applied
      on the ADR property.

   Example(s):
      ADR;TYPE=billing:;;123 Main Street;Any Town;CA;91921-1234;U.S.A.

5.2.  Delivery Address Type Value

   Value:  delivery

   Purpose:  Indicates using this address for delivery, e.g., to send
      packages to.

   Conformance:  This value can be used with the TYPE parameter applied
      on the ADR property.

   Example(s):
      ADR;TYPE=delivery:;;123 Main Street;Any Town;CA;91921-1234;U.S.A.

6.  Security Considerations
