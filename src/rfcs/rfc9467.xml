      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-1">The design of the Babel MAC authentication mechanism <xref target="RFC8967" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="RFC8967"/> assumes that packet reordering is an exceptional
occurrence, and the protocol drops any packets that arrive out-of-order.
The assumption that packets are not routinely reordered is generally
correct on wired links, but turns out to be incorrect on some kinds of
wireless links.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-2">In particular, IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) <xref target="IEEE80211" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="IEEE80211"/> defines
a number of power-saving modes that allow stations (mobile nodes) to
switch their radio off for extended periods of time, ranging in the
hundreds of milliseconds.  The access point (network switch) buffers all
multicast packets and only sends them out after the power-saving interval
ends.  The result is that multicast packets are delayed by up to a few
hundred milliseconds with respect to unicast packets, which, under some
traffic patterns, causes the Packet Counter (PC) verification procedure in
RFC 8967 to systematically fail for multicast packets.</t>
      <t indent="0" pn="section-1-3">This document defines two distinct ways to relax the PC validation:</t>

        <li pn="section-1-4.2">using a window of
previously received PC values (<xref target="window" format="default" sectionFormat="of" derivedContent="Section 3.2"/>), which allows
a bounded amount of reordering between arbitrary packets.</li>

          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.1-1">Modern networking hardware tends to maintain more than just two queues,
and it might be tempting to generalise the approach taken to more than
just the two last PC values.  For example, one might be tempted to use
distinct last PC values for packets received with different values of the
Type of Service (TOS) field, or with different IEEE 802.11 access
categories.  However, choosing a highest PC field by consulting a value
that is not protected by the Message Authentication Code (MAC) (<xref target="RFC8967" section="4.1" sectionFormat="of" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8967#section-4.1" derivedContent="RFC8967"/>) would no longer protect against replay.
In effect, this means that only the destination address and port number
as well as the data stored in the packet body may be used for choosing the highest PC
value, since these are the only fields that are protected by the MAC (in
addition to the source address and port number, which are already used
when choosing the neighbour table entry and therefore provide no
additional information).  Since Babel implementations do not usually send
packets with differing TOS values or IEEE 802.11 access categories, this
is unlikely to be an issue in practice.</t>
          <t indent="0" pn="section-3.1.1-2">The following example shows why it would be unsafe to select the highest
PC depending on the TOS field.  Suppose that a node B were to maintain
distinct highest PC values for different values T1 and T2 of the TOS field,
and that, initially, all of the highest PC fields at B have value 42.  Suppose
now that a node A sends a packet P1 with TOS equal to T1 and PC equal to
43; when B receives the packet, it sets the highest PC value associated with
TOS T1 to 43.  If an attacker were now to send an exact copy of P1 but
with TOS equal to T2, B would consult the highest PC value associated with
T2, which is still equal to 42, and accept the replayed packet.</t>

When using window-based verification,
in addition to retaining within its neighbour table the highest PC value
PCh seen from every neighbour, an implementation maintains a fixed-size

precisely, the (Index, PC) pair contained in the neighbour table (<xref target="RFC8967" section="3.2" sectionFormat="of" format="default" derivedLink="https://rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8967#section-3.2" derivedContent="RFC8967"/>) is replaced by:</t>

unicast packet counter is made by examining a packet's destination IP address,
which is included in the pseudo-header and therefore participates in MAC
computation. Hence, an attacker cannot change the destination address without
invalidating the MAC, and therefore cannot replay a unicast packet as a
multicast one or vice versa.</t>

state maintained by each node, this increase is marginal (between 4 and 36
octets per neighbour, depending on implementation choices), and should not
significantly impact the ability of nodes to survive denial-of-service
attacks.</t>
