The use of IS-IS at larger scale\r\nrequires faster flooding rates to achieve desired convergence goals. \r\nThis document discusses the need for faster flooding, the issues\r\naround faster flooding, and some example approaches to achieve faster\r\nflooding. It also defines protocol extensions relevant to faster\r\nflooding.","pub_date":"November 2024","keywords":["LSP","congestion","flow control","scale","performance","IS-S","flooding"],"obsoletes":[],"obsoleted_by":[],"updates":[],"updated_by":[],"see_also":[],"doi":"10.17487\/RFC9681","errata_url":null}
